TEASER

FADE IN: INT. - COCKPIT - BOMBER - NIGHT

The bomber is flying through the air.

[Transcriber's Note: Because I can't possibly identify the several pilots'
voices in this opening segment, they are all simply listed as "PILOT". When
it moves down to a new PILOT, that represents a different, although not
necessarily new, voice.]

PILOT
Tango Outlaw 1-6, Raven One approaching An Khe.

PILOT
Roger One. Operation is in heavy contact at Bravo Romeo 945374. They need
FAC ASAP. Fox Mike 45.8.

PILOT
Coming up on your wing, lead. You drawing targets?

PILOT
Roger, two. First drop's just beyond the tree line.

PILOT
I've got it.

PILOT
Keep up your speed. Don't stop.

We hear the instrument panel beeping in one of the bombers.

PILOT
They just salvoed.

PILOT
Locked on target.

PILOT
Raven two locked on target.

PILOT
We've been hit.

PILOT
Fire light's on. Can you see, two?

PILOT
Clear off the wing. You've got two tanks near the fire.

PILOT
We've lost hydraulics.

We see several pilots eject out of their cockpits.

CUT TO: INT. - DINNER ROOM - NIGHT
      TUESDAY NIGHT

Leo is speaking at a podium. Many people are seated in the audience.

LEO
So, so he says, "That's my Mulligan." And I say, "But you've already taken
your Mulligan." "Yeah," Kenny says, "but we're playing Texas rules."

The audience applauds and laughs.

LEO
Okay, okay, let's try to forget for a moment his success in the private sector
creating jobs and generating enormous tax revenues the President and I get
to fool around with. And let's talk about his commitment to his community;
Chairman of the Board of University Medical Center, the Opera Society and
Symphony, although I suspect the opera thing is more Sally. CEO and Chairman
of Mueller-Wright Aeronautics and this year's Chicago Business Conference
Humanitarian of the Year. The finest man that I have ever had the great
privilege to call my friend, your own Kenneth Sean O'Neal.

The people in the audience stand and applaud. The man to Leo's immediate left,
KENNETH SEAN O'NEAL, and his wife, SALLY, stand as well. Leo gives Ken a hug.

CUT TO: EXT. - STREET - OUTSIDE BUILDING - NIGHT

Leo, Ken, and Sally are talking.

O'NEAL
Thanks for coming, Leo.

LEO
I wouldn't have missed it for the world. How are Beth and Sandy?

SALLY
Beth's expecting again, and Sandy is Sandy.

LEO
How's Ramses coming along?

O'NEAL
Oh, Armed Services is holding it up again. I'm going to go in and talk to
them on Thursday. You free for lunch?

LEO
If I'm not, I'll make sure I will be. You want me to place a call?

O'NEAL
To Hunt? No, thanks.

LEO
Congratulations, Kenny.

They hug.

O'NEAL
Now, you're coming to Hilton Head this summer. No arguments, no lame excuses
that you're saving the world for democracy.

LEO
Saving it from democracy's more what it feels like. I'll see you on Thursday.

O'NEAL
Thursday.

SALLY
Bye now.

Leo gets into a cab that is waiting by the road.

ABBY [prelap]
Stop being a baby about this.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Bartlet and Abby are in the bathroom talking.

BARTLET
I don't need a portrait.

ABBY
Of course you do.

BARTLET
What, me with my Irish Wolfhound gazing with portent out over the Potomac?

ABBY
You don't have an Irish Wolfhound.

BARTLET
My point exactly.

The phone starts ringing. Bartlet answers it.

BARTLET
[into phone] Yeah. ... Sure, send him in.

He hangs the phone up.

BARTLET
Charlie. And when am I supposed to find time to sit for some cut-rate Ruebens
while he angles me just so to catch the late afternoon light?

ABBY
You do know it's not a nude, right?

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bartlet and Abby walk in. The steward lets Charlie in.

CHARLIE
Excuse me, Mr. President. Mrs. Bartlet, sorry to bother you.

ABBY
Oh, no. Come on in, bring your jammies. We're about to start the pillow fight.

CHARLIE
The General's waiting outside.

ABBY
Why not invite him in, too? I'll pop some popcorn, we'll watch Patton on cable.

Bartlet leaves the bedroom and walks out into the sitting room.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

General Alexander is waiting by the window when Bartlet comes in.

ALEXANDER
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

BARTLET
What's happened?

ALEXANDER
A Navy E-2 Hawkeye providing command and control for the Carl Vinsen Carrier
Battle Group went down in the Sea of Japan.

BARTLET
Any survivors?

ALEXANDER
Yes, sir. We believe so. We're picking up signals from four of their five
GPS locator beacons.

BARTLET
So we got get them.

ALEXANDER
They may be difficult to retrieve in their current location.

BARTLET
Where are they?

ALEXANDER
Somewhere north of Kimch'ack, 300 kilometers northeast of P'yongyang, in
the Republic of North Korea.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

On a camera, we see Leo outside the Situation room. He opens the door and
walks in. He sits next to Bartlet.

BARTLET
How was Chicago?

LEO
Quick. Where are we?

ALEXANDER
An E-2C Hawkeye was being harassed by two North Korean MiGs over the Sea of
Japan. The MiGs had made two non-firing passes, one less than ten feet off
his wing.

LEO
The crew make it out?

ALEXANDER
We've located four of the five crew members and identified two large pieces
of wreckage a mile off the coast.

LEO
Our people are in the water?

ADMIRAL MCGILL
They were, but now their GPS beacons indicate they're on land.

LEO
In North Korea.

BARTLET
What will the crew do?

LEO
Lay low, stay out of sight, wait for us to come get them.

A man, later identified as BARROW, speaks.

BARROW
We can't go get them. Sending a Special Forces covert retrieval team into
North Korea will be seen as an act of war.

LEO
We're still at war with North Korea. We never signed an armistice.

ALEXANDER
If they capture our people, they'll be held as POWs. Or worse, they'll deny
they even have them.

BARROW
We can negotiate for their safe return.

ALEXANDER
Can you guarantee they'll negotiate?

BARROW
Can you guarantee you can go get them without starting another war?

BARTLET
Do we have any way of confirming that they're still alive?

MCGILL
They were in the water, now they're on land.

LEO
We have any keyhole satellites currently in position?

ALEXANDER
We're scrambling reconnaissance out of Okinawa and Osan. Should be over the
crash site in three hours.

BARTLET
Call me when you know.



Bartlet stands. Everyone follows.

ALL
Thank you, sir.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - DAY

C.J. is walking into the lobby. Carol has met her there and is talking to her.

CAROL
Last night's summaries, the daybook, press guidance from the NSC and the
policy shops, State department cables. Legislative Affairs says a new
amendment is moving through Ways and Means. Congressman Wendt wants a tax
cut for stay-at-home moms.

C.J.
Too late to slip in incentives for stay-at-home Congressmen?

CAROL
The President's flying to Wendt's district in South Carolina on Saturday. They
want you to read the guidance before the gaggle. Think it might come up.

C.J.
Really? You think?

CAROL
So, tomorrow's the big day?

C.J.
What?

CAROL
Mystery Ben.

C.J.
What about him?

CAROL
He's coming by to say hello.

C.J.
No, he isn't.

CAROL
He's in town and he called.

C.J.
And you gave him an appointment?

CAROL
He seemed nice.

C.J.
He is nice. Very nice. Also very married.

CAROL
Not anymore.

C.J.
He and Katie split up?

CAROL
Katie's living in Portland with an orthodontist.

C.J.
Really?

CAROL
And Toby and Josh are in your office.

C.J.
What do they want?

CAROL
To make fun of you, I think.

C.J.
And you let them in?

CAROL
And got them coffee.

C.J. walks into her office. Josh and Toby are in there.

JOSH
We've got a problem with the South Carolina trip. Congressman Wendt, who
single-handedly blocked our tax credit to expand child care for working
families, is attempting to bind the feet of your entire gender with his
paleo-chauvinist stay-at-home tax cut.

C.J.
I'm going to read the bill and supporting materials now.

JOSH
What if you just kick up a cloud of dust about the revenue impact and mention
he's the Darth Vader of child care?

C.J.
What if I take a minute to read the bill and supporting materials?

JOSH
We're already rolling over on the tax side. The indexing provision...

C.J.
Can I please take a moment to read the bill and supporting materials?

She sits down at her desk. Josh sits across from her.

C.J.
Okay, what?

TOBY
We think you should go on The Taylor Reid Show.


JOSH
The chicken thing has legs.

TOBY
With those pointy little toes.

C.J.
No.

JOSH
The Washington Wire has Tyson Foods offering you a lifetime supply of wings
and thighs if you'll do a print ad for whole fryers.

TOBY
And the Reliable Source notes that the Oval Room...

JOSH
Your favorite restaurant.

TOBY
... has a new menu item - an ungodly combination of chicken, avocado, and
poached egg called "The C.J. Cregg Egg."

C.J.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

JOSH
Go on the show, call his bluff, show you have a sense of humor.

TOBY
You could wear a chicken suit.

JOSH
Take him even semi-seriously, he'll lay off and find another cluck to pluck.

C.J.
A chicken suit?

Will walks in.

WILL
Josh, Leo's looking for you.

Josh gets up to leave.

WILL
Hey you should read the Wendt Amendment.

C.J.
I'm trying to read it now.

WILL
It's pretty narrowly drawn, actually. Not the worst thing. She see it
last night?

C.J.
See what?

WILL
She doesn't know?

C.J.
Know what?

JOSH
Taylor Reid was talking about your spin on the decline of manufacturing jobs
and he said...

Josh starts laughing and Toby finishes the sentence.

TOBY
"The tall lady's back to telling tall tales."

C.J.
The tall lady?

 JOSH
The tall lady.

C.J. stands up and calls to Carol.

C.J.
Carol, call the Taylor Reid Show, book me on the next available slot. [to
Toby] I'm gonna reach down and rip off his puny little face.

CUT TO: INT. - MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY

Margaret turns the light on in her office and walks into Leo's office.

MARGARET
You're already here.

LEO
I came in straight from Dulles.

MARGARET
At 2:00 in the morning?

LEO
I need a clean shirt. What happened to the one I brought in the other day?

MARGARET
It had a hole in the sleeve, so I took it home.

LEO
To do what with it?

MARGARET
Sew up the hole.

LEO
Now you're mending my clothes?

MARGARET
You want some breakfast?

LEO
I want a clean shirt.

Josh walks in.

JOSH
You looking for me?

LEO
You still on good terms with Hunt?

JOSH
I don't think the Senator's going to invite me down to his ranch to lasso
a bull any time soon, but he returns my calls.

LEO
The LC-104 Ramses project.

MARGARET
They need you in the Sit Room.

JOSH
The chopper Mueller-Wright's building for the Army?

LEO
Hunt's bottling it up in committee.

They walk out into the hall and continue talking as they head toward the
Sit Room.

JOSH
Probably because it's being built in 16 different states, none of them
named Arizona.

LEO
Find out what's going on with the Ramses thing, will you?

JOSH
Wendt has stuck on another one of his "moving America back to the Mamie
Eisenhower Era" amendments.

LEO
What is it this time?

JOSH
Tax cuts for stay-at-home moms.

LEO
The President's headed down to his district on Saturday.

JOSH
Yeah, I don't think the timing's accidental.

LEO
Okay, pull together a briefing, and I'll get you a few minutes with the
President.

Josh walks off and so does Leo.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Donna is seated at her cubicle. Josh walks up and begins talking to her.

JOSH
Donna! Can you see if Senator Hunt's office can find me a couple minutes
this morning? Is Jimmy Olsen with us today?

DONNA
Ryan!

Ryan walks up.

JOSH
You know who Sam Wendt is?

RYAN
Democrat from the Oregon Fifth?

JOSH
Republican from the South Carolina Second, but you were close. He introduced
an amendment to use the tax code to subsidize stay-at-home moms.

They walk over to the coffee pot.

RYAN
That's interesting.

JOSH
No, not really. He kills child care proposals, and tries to get us to print
the Ten Commandments on the back of the two-dollar bill.

RYAN
Be nice to have them wallet-sized.

They walk into Josh's office.

JOSH
Read the different drafts of the amendment. Show how many more women would
have benefited from the President's child care tax credit than from Wendt's
stay-at-home proposal. Treasury, JTC scoring, and a year-by-year impact on
the deficit for a Presidential briefing tomorrow.

RYAN
I'm going to brief the President?

JOSH
No, I'm going to brief the President and take credit for all your hard work,
but you get to come.

RYAN
Great. Sure, tomorrow. Uh, JTC is...?

DONNA
Joint Tax Committee.

Ryan and Donna walk out. Donna comes back and stands against the doorframe.

JOSH
What? It's scut work.

DONNA
Presidential scut work.

JOSH
You want to spend the day reading mind-numbing spreadsheets?

DONNA
Mind-numbing Presidential spreadsheets.

JOSH
Well, channel your Presidential disappointment into getting me five minutes
with Matt Hunt, okay? Please?

She leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

ALEXANDER
There's no activity of any kind in the crew's location. No vehicles, no
movement or troops or equipment. The Hook 112 receivers indicate our people
are in this densely wooded area here. There is, however, extraordinary
activity out to sea in the general vicinity of the crash site.

LEO
How long before they figure out our guys made it to shore?

ALEXANDER
It's hard to say. Right now, it looks as if they're assuming no one got out.

BARTLET
What's the plan, Admiral?

MCGILL
A four-man SEAL team will HALO drop over the crash site under cover of
darkness.

BARTLET
HALO drop?

LEO
They jump out at 40,000 feet, deploy their chutes at 2,000 feet.

MCGILL
They'll gather the crew, get them into a Zodiac, and head back out to seas 12
miles due east where they'll be met by a Super Sea Stallion rescue chopper. The
Sea Stallion will then fly them east 200 miles to the USS Cowpens.

BARROW
So, your SEAL team, they'll be armed?

MCGILL
Yes, sir.

BARROW
And if they run into resistance from the North Koreans, they'll start shooting?

ALEXANDER
You want them to drop in unarmed?

BARROW
Mr. President, if the North Koreans discover armed American soldiers on
Korean soil...

BARTLET
We go get 'em.

BARROW
Mr. President, there are other...

LEO
We don't leave our people in harm's way, Mr. Barrow. We bring 'em home.

Bartlet stands. Everyone follows.

BARTLET
Admiral, go get our boys.

ALL
Thank you, Mr. President.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - WAITING ROOM - OUTSIDE SENATOR HUNT'S OFFICE - DAY

Josh is waiting outside Senator Hunt's office. An assistant speaks to Josh.

ASSISTANT
The senator will see you now Mr. Lyman.

Josh walks back into the Senator's office.

JOSH
Thank you for seeing me, Senator.

SENATOR HUNT
You still getting in a little handball now and then, Josh?

JOSH
As the years go by, I want my sports with a little more leverage, like, say,
a racquet.

HUNT
Well, I'm down at the club most mornings, 6:00 am sharp.

JOSH
I don't know if my ego could take another shellacking like last time.

HUNT
So, what can I do for you?

JOSH
The LC-104 Ramses Transport Chopper program. The DoD already approved the
purchase.

HUNT
At six billion. Now Mueller-Wright says it's going to cost ten.

JOSH
The Army changed the order.

HUNT
The upgrades are all subcontractor parts, and the reactive armor was a
requirement in the initial RFP.

JOSH
Well, the Army needs them, and they need them sooner, rather than later.

HUNT
You going to lecture me on military preparedness, Josh?

Josh laughs.

HUNT
What branch of the service did you serve in? I've forgotten. Why are you
here? Kenny O'Neal pick up the phone and call Leo?

Josh stands up.

JOSH
What's your real concern here, Senator? That none of the Ramses project
subcontractors are from Arizona?

HUNT
You tell Leo that the Armed Services Committee is going to exercise its
oversight prerogative. Mr. O'Neal is just going to have to wait.

Josh walks off.

CAROL [prelap]

The Taylor Reid Show can get you on tomorrow. They're going to clear...

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J. and Carol are walking through the hallways toward C.J.'s office.

CAROL [cont.]
... a few scheduled guests for you.

C.J.
I'm going to carve him into McNuggets.

CAROL
They want you there by 11:45 for the noon segment. You're on the air for
seven minutes, back by one, just in time to say hello to Ben.

C.J.
Ask Media Affairs to do a background on Reid's questioning style and a list
of recurring topics.

CAROL
Interior's transferring Ben to DC. He's looking for advice on a place to live.

Abbey walks up to the door of C.J.'s office.

ABBEY
Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting.

C.J.
Oh, no ma'am. Come on in. Carol's just trying to get me excited about an
old beau.

CAROL
He's a Ranger.

ABBEY
Dashing.

CAROL
Works with at-risk kids, too.

ABBEY
Sold.

C.J.
How are you, Mrs. Bartlet?

ABBEY
Fine. I just wanted to give you a heads-up, in case anyone mentions it a
press briefing. I'm going to start volunteering.

C.J.
Volunteering, ma'am?

ABBEY
At the Washington Free Clinic.

C.J.
You're going to start practicing medicine again?

ABBEY
I'll just be helping out a bit. I won't be doing any heart transplants.

C.J.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Are you licensed to practice medicine again?

ABBEY
I voluntarily chose to stop practicing, C.J. And now I'm choosing to give
a few underprivileged toddlers vaccinations. I never said I was hanging up
my stethoscope for good.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh is walking toward his office. Donna and Will are following him.

JOSH
See if Leo's available, and find out if Senator Canton's around.

DONNA
For a call, or face-to-face?

WILL
It'll have to be a call. Canton's in Seattle, NAACP convention. What do you
need Canton for?

Donna leaves the office.

JOSH
Hunt's threatening to bottle up the Ramses thing. I need a Democrat on Armed
Services to run interference.

WILL
I've been thinking about this Wendt amendment. Maybe we should give it
another look.

JOSH
Tax credits for stay-at-home moms?

WILL
Might not be such a bad thing.

JOSH
For the floor wax industry, maybe.

WILL
Working families are struggling. They need our help.

JOSH
You already auditioning one-liners for New Hampshire?

Ryan walks in as Josh sits down.

RYAN
I've been reading this Wendt stuff. It might not be such a bad thing.

WILL
See? What'd I tell you?

RYAN
A-A major study Wendt commissioned of... 1,364 children showed a clear
link between parents' dumping their kids in day care and an increase in
hyperactivity, lack of discipline, and violent behaviour.

WILL
Can I see that?

JOSH
You're saying Jeffrey Dahmer's only problem was day care?

RYAN
We're always harping about the root causes of crime and violence.

JOSH
I work for the federal government. I-I've never heard of Wendt's so-called
"Major federal study."

WILL
Maybe that's because all TV news programs are produced by mothers who dump
their kids in day care.

JOSH
'Kay, I think we need more women in the workforce, specifically to keep you
two out.

Ryan turns to walk out.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

McGill is standing in front of a screen. He has an earpiece radio on.

MCGILL
The MC-130 is approaching the drop zone at 48,000 feet. They'll do a rapid
descend to 38,000 for the drop.

MC-130 PILOT
Carolina to ODS. Confirming traffic lights.

COWPENS OPERATOR
Location scattered in angle formation east. Mapped on the grid in five.

MCGILL
That's the pilot confirming the North Korean lights below him.

MC-130 PILOT
That's affirmative. Same view from the top.  Operation Shore Leave to commence
at oh-four-hundred-two.

ALEXANDER
They're waiting for your go, sir.

Bartlet nods to Alexander. Alexander nods to McGill.

MCGILL
That's affirmative.

COWPENS OPERATER
That's affirmative, Carolina.

MC-130 PILOT
Roger, ODS. Going dark.

COWPENS OPERATOR
God be with you.

UNIT LEADER
Jump permission granted. Units one and two, go. Unit three, go.

We see several people from the SEAL team jump from the airplane.

CUT TO: EXT. - JUNGLE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

We see a younger KENNY O'NEAL dragging an also younger Leo, who has a broken
leg, through the jungle. A heavy rain is falling. We hear distant voices
and can see a soldier moving through the jungle. Kenny drags Leo to a spot
and leans him against a tree. Kenny also ducks.

O'NEAL
Shh!

We see two soldiers walk by just above the two men's heads. We hear the
soldiers speaking a foreign language. When they have passed, Kenny moves
over to Leo to look at his leg. There is an open wound. The younger man
opens a packet of something and pours it into the wound.

LEO
I think it's broken. Oh! You got to go. I'll be okay.

O'NEAL
We bailed pretty close to Rest Camp. We'll head out that way.

LEO
It's a couple miles. You can't be dragging me all over the jungle.

Kenny ties a bandage around Leo's wound.

LEO
You'll never make it with me along.

O'NEAL
You're not so heavy, old man.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is seated at his desk. He is obviously thinking about something. Josh
calls to him and we see that Josh is standing in the doorway.

JOSH
Leo? You got a minute?

LEO
Yeah, sure.

JOSH
Hunt isn't going to back off.

LEO
What's his problem?

JOSH
He implied you had me inquiring on behalf of Ken O'Neal.

LEO
I'll call Hunt.

JOSH
I tracked down Dave Canton. Asked him what had the Chairman so riled up. He
said Mueller-Wright circumvented DoD protocol to get the deal approved.

LEO
There are thousands of procurement regs over at DoD. If somebody at
Muller-Wright forgot to do some due diligence, they'll sort it out.

JOSH
Canton says they never did an AOA. Hunt has an investigation going. He wants
subpoenas, hearings.

LEO
Over an AOA?

JOSH
Canton says Ken O'Neal is going to be the first witness subpoenaed.

LEO
Margaret!

Margaret comes in.

LEO
Call Matt Hunt's office. Tell him I'm coming over, now.

Leo gets up and starts putting his coat on.

JOSH
You worked for Mueller-Wright. If they're involved in procurement
irregularities, any attempt on your part to impede a Senate...

LEO
I'm not going to "impede" anything. Thanks. I'll take it from here.

JOSH
Did you know Senator Hunt in the military?

LEO
No. He was later. Cambodia and Laos. It was a big war.

Leo leaves his office.

CUT TO: EXT. - JUNGLE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

We see Leo is still leaned up against the tree.

LEO
Please. You gotta go.

O'NEAL
I'm not leaving you, Leo, so forget it. Come on.

Kenny drags Leo away from the base of the tree. He then picks Leo up and
puts him on his shoulder. Then, he begins walking into the jungle.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - SENATOR HUNT'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo and Hunt are seated at his desk and they are talking.

LEO
The Army sped up the timeline because, if you haven't noticed, the threat
to our guys has increased.

HUNT
Are you questioning my patriotism?

LEO
Cut the crap, Matt. I've got old service ribbons gathering dust in a drawer
somewhere, too.

HUNT
We had companies with lower bids.

LEO
Airbus. Congress wasn't going to let the Pentagon award a ten billion dollar
defense contract to the French.

HUNT
If Mueller-Wright couldn't make the choppers for the price, then they
shouldn't have bid.

LEO
So, now you're going to drag Ken O'Neal in front of a network perp-walk over
a weapons system we have to have that no one else can build?

HUNT
If Mr. O'Neal is subpoenaed to appear before my committee, it will be to
answer legitimate questions about the manner in which Mueller-Wright secured
those contracts.

LEO
You know damn well the charge screams louder than the verdict. If you don't
like the price, tell the DoD to renegotiate it.

HUNT
It's not about price anymore, Leo. It's about process and patronage.

LEO
You're accusing me of using my influence to get them the contract?

HUNT
Well, how many years did you work for Mueller-Wright? Was it 10? 12?

LEO
Don't try to embarrass me and, through me, the President by humiliating an
outstanding American patriot.

HUNT
Well, now who's waving the flag, Leo?

Leo stands up.

LEO
If you're drawing up partisan subpoena lists, Matt, put my name on top.

Leo leaves.

WOMAN [prelap]
When you're talking...

CUT TO: INT. - STUDIO - TAYLOR REID SHOW - DAY
      THURSDAY MORNING

C.J. is getting ready to go on the air. A woman is talking to her as she
leads her to her seat at the table across from Reid.

WOMAN [cont.]
... address Taylor, not the camera. If he points to the Truth Meter...

C.J.
The Truth Meter? Am I on a game show?

WOMAN
If he points to the Truth Meter keep looking at Taylor.

C.J.
If he dunks me in a river and I float, does that mean I'm a witch?

She walks over and sits next to Reid at the table.

MAN
Back in ten.

REID
God, it's great you could join us. I'm a huge fan.

MAN
Five, four, three...

They begin the show.

REID
As promised, White House Press Secretary C.J. Cregg has finally agreed to
join us. Ms. Cregg, global warming. That's a liberal fantasy, isn't it?

C.J.
No, it's not.

REID
Voodoo environmentalism without any scientific...

C.J.
There are about 16 Nobel laureates, 57 World Bank economists, and 17
scientific studies...

REID
The World Bank is the U.N. for tree huggers. They think companies that create
jobs and help big industry...

C.J.
That's ridiculous.

REID
If it's ridiculous you should stop funding them. Judicial nominees. The
United States Senate doesn't think it's a good idea to approve of Bartlet's
liberal judges that treat the Constitution...

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Josh and Toby are watching the show on the TV.

REID
[on TV] ... like it's some kind of beer coaster.

C.J.
[on TV] The President has nominated dozens of highly qualified...

JOSH
How's she doing?

TOBY
I think the Christians did a little better with the lions.

They walk into Toby's office.

JOSH
It's only the first round, she's still testing out her jab.

TOBY
She better go to her hook soon.

JOSH
I just got a call from Hunt's office. Apparently, Leo has asked to be
subpoenaed for the hearings on the Ramses.

TOBY
He asked to be subpoenaed?

JOSH
Hunt's asking for all e-mails within the DoD and Mueller-Wright. He thinks
the bid process was rigged. He threatened to subpoena O'Neal. Apparently
Leo rose to Ken's defense.

TOBY
Leo can't testify in front of the Armed Services Committee. Did you talk
to him?

JOSH
I tried.

TOBY
Does the President know?

JOSH
Should he?

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Several men are standing around as Bartlet walks in. They begin discussing
the situation.

ALL
Mr. President.

BARTLET
We get 'em back?

MCGILL
We got single confirmation bursts from the SEAL team CSELs. They're now with
the downed crew from the Hawkeye.

BARTLET
Are they in the water yet?

ALEXANDER
No, sir. But they've moved closer to the beach area, stopped in these woods.

BARTLET
Why?

LEO
The sun came up.

BARTLET
So, now what? They just wait around until the sun goes back down?

MCGILL
Yes, sir.

BARROW
Let's hope no one decides to go berry picking in those woods today.

CAROL [prelap]
You sure you don't want anything in it?

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Carol is seated at her desk. Ben is seated across from her. He is mostly
hidden behind the door and we are only able to see his face near the end of
the conversation when he leans forward.

BEN
No. Black's great. [pause] You know, maybe it'd be better for me to wait in
the lobby.

CAROL
No, please. C.J. should be back soon.

BEN
We met in Principles of Sociology. It was the only class at Berkeley that
the Land Management kids and the Poli Sci students took together.

CAROL
You studied range management?

BEN
Yeah. Grassland, savanna, shrubland ecology. Thank God the Park Service
hired me. I don't know what else my education would be good for. Selling seed
catalogues, maybe. I don't know. [pause] I've got a picture of us together
in college. Would you like to see it?

He gets out the picture and shows it to Carol.

BEN
It's, a, uh... there. That's right after we started living together. God,
she was something in a bikini, huh? She ever tell you about getting arrested
for stealing that donkey down in Cabo?

We see, on the TV behind Ben's shoulder, that the Taylor Reid Show is about
to come back on.

CUT TO: INT. - STUDIO - TAYLOR REID SHOW - DAY

Reid and C.J. are preparing to return to the air.

C.J.
You're not giving me a chance to answer. If you just want to bloviate,
why don't I leave a cardboard cutout of myself and you can talk all you want.

MAN
In five, four, three...

REID
You're doing great.

They begin the show.

REID
We are back with C.J. Cregg, who says she could have sent a cardboard
cutout of herself for all we're going to get out of her today. C.J., the
First Lady is back to practicing medicine at a Southeast DC clinic. Isn't
she breaking her promise to the American people? Didn't she say she wasn't
going to practice medicine again after lying to keep her husband's condition
a secret from the American voters?

C.J.
The First Lady is volunteering in a free clinic in one of the poorest
neighborhoods in the nation, helping to save children's lives.

REID
Don't you think the First Lady should try to fix health care in this country
as opposed to repairing her own self-image?

C.J.
She's and M.D., she can fix whatever she damn well pleases, and if it were
health care, you'd try and block it.

REID
That's not true, I'm for sensible health care. I'm just against socialized
medicine.

C.J.
No, you're not.

REID
Let's talk about how the First Lady lied to the American people.

C.J.
No, let's talk about your paid speeches to the pharmaceutical lobby...

REID
It's a free country.

C.J.
... and your paid speeches to the HMO and insurance lobby, and how every
time health care reform comes up on your show you're miraculously against
it. The First Lady is rolling up her sleeves and getting something done,
and you're not because you're too busy depositing their checks, and let's
talk about who's chicken.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Charlie is seated at his desk and Debbie at hers. Toby and Josh are standing
and waiting to talk to Bartlet. The TV is showing the Taylor Reid Show.

JOSH
Well, she won that round on all cards.

TOBY
How much longer do you think?

DEBBIE
I have no idea.

JOSH
Leo knows he can't testify on behalf of a major defense contractor. What's
he thinking?

TOBY
He's not thinking.

JOSH
How long did they serve together?

TOBY
Leo and O'Neal? I don't know. Awhile before they were shot down.

CHARLIE
Leo was shot down?

JOSH
Over Hanoi. They hid out in the jungle until they were rescued.

TOBY
Can I get a ballpark on how much longer it's going to be? An era, a Tchaikovsky
symphony, a brief Ice Age perhaps?

DEBBIE
You have some food stuck in your beard.

CHARLIE
How long was he there for?

JOSH
Three days.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated next to a man named MR. THOMAS. Debbie knocks and comes in.

DEBBIE
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Ziegler is being rather insistent.

BARTLET
As he so often is. [to Thomas] Excuse me, Mr. Thomas. Give me some time to
think about it.

MR. THOMAS
Mr. President.

Toby and Josh come in as leaves.

BARTLET
So, what's so important? Someone get the words to "Yellow Submarine"
wrong again?

JOSH
It's about Leo, sir.

LEO [prelap]
And we still haven't heard from Ken?

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is seated and Margaret is talking to him.

MARGARET
I left messages at his office and with his hotel in Chicago.

LEO
We were supposed to have lunch. Call his office back and find out what
meetings he had this morning.

Bartlet knocks and comes in from the Oval Office. Leo stands up.

BARTLET
Got a minute.

LEO
Yes, sir, of course.

BARTLET
No word yet on the SEAL team?

LEO
No, sir, not yet.

BARTLET
Toby and Josh came to see me about this Muller-Wright thing.

LEO
I told Josh I'd handle it.

BARTLET
By going before the Armed Services Committee?

LEO
Hunt's trying to use my friendship with Ken O'Neal to embarrass this
administration.

BARTLET
And testifying in front of a Congressional committee is going to lessen
that embarrassment?

LEO
Hunt's bluffing. He's upset Arizona manufacturers didn't get any of the
contract.

BARTLET
Well, you were a senior corporate officer at Mueller-Wright for over ten
years, right, Leo? You can't testify.

LEO
It's not going to come to that.

BARTLET
It opens you up to being called before Congressional committees on a whim.

LEO
I won't stand by while Hunt slanders a good man's name for political purposes.

BARTLET
And Josh seems to think that...

LEO
Josh doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.

BARTLET
Have you asked Kenny if there's any truth...

LEO
I've know Ken O'Neal for thirty-five years. I've worked beside him, served
beside him... He hasn't done anything wrong.

Bartlet nods.

BARTLET
You can't testify, Leo.

LEO
I won't desert him, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Have you asked Kenny if there's any truth to the rumors...

LEO
I don't have to.

Bartlet leaves and Leo sits back down.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated at his desk, Charlie is standing behind him, and Debbie
is standing across from his desk.

BARTLET
Still nothing from General Alexander?

CHARLIE
No, sir. And Josh is waiting to give you a Ways and Means briefing.

BARTLET
What Ways and Means briefing?

DEBBIE
The South Carolina trip, sir. And then you have INS on border security and
at 4:00, the National Medal of Arts recipients are coming by.

BARTLET
You a Crosby, Stills and Nash fan?

DEBBIE
I've always been more of a Crazy Horse gal, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah, I could see how that would be.

DEBBIE
Although I did have a tempestuous affair with a rodeo cowboy during the summer
of love that the Hollies played a significant role in. I'll call Josh in.

Bartlet and Charlie stare at her as she leaves. Josh and Ryan come in.

BARTLET
So what's this problem I'm hearing about with Saturday's trip to South
Carolina?

JOSH
Wendt wants a tax cut for stay-at-home moms. Unless you're a poor woman,
then, of course, he'd argue you have to work or else you should be denied
welfare benefits. Next, he'll try to slip dishwasher subsidies into the
omnibus reconciliation bill. Our caucus has been fighting for more daycare,
more after-school care, transportation subsidies to make it easier for poor
women to get to good jobs. They can't justify spending, uh...

RYAN
JTC scores it at 11 billion over five years.

JOSH
... 11 billion to keep Wilma Flinstone in dinosaur-skin coats while most
women are struggling to find someone to take care of their child.

BARTLET
What's the tax benefit for the typical family?

JOSH
About $100 a year.

RYAN
Closer to $300. But that's not the point. A typical family of four making
$68,000 can still get $1200 in child care tax credits if the wife decides
to work, but if she wants to stay home with the kids we don't help.

BARTLET
Who's this?

JOSH
Ryan Pierce. He's interning in my office for a few months...

BARTLET
Pierce?

JOSH
... maybe less.

BARTLET
Senator Pierce's son?

RYAN
He's my uncle.

BARTLET
So, which would you choose, Ryan, daycare tax cut of this?

RYAN
Daycare, but why should we choose for everybody else?

BARTLET
What would you suggest?

RYAN
Tell Wendt you understand that he didn't want to support your child care
tax credit when there's no help for stay-at-home moms, so he should find
some loophole closers we can agree on to pay for both. He's on Ways and
Means. That's where the money is, right?

BARTLET
Right. Thank you.

Josh and Ryan leave.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J. and Carol are talking.

C.J.
That was fun.

CAROL
You did great.

C.J.
Sanctimonious little guttersnipe sent a great big fat one, up and over the
plate. 'Health Care Reform'? From a guy who's still on the fence about the
application of leeches?

She makes a batting gesture with the paper in her hands.

CAROL
He wants you back.

C.J.
'Sensible Health Care'? He means a bedpan, a gurney, and a check from the
"Your Claim's Been Rejected" lobby.

CAROL
You missed Ben. He hung around for a while but he had to get back for a
meeting at Interior.

C.J.
How's he look?

CAROL
If you don't want him, can I have him?

C.J.
He still have that ruffled hair, Redford in The Way We Were kind of thing
going on?

CAROL
He left you a note and a picture.

C.J. comes over to her desk to read the note.

RYAN [prelap]
He asked a question.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh and Ryan are walking and talking.

JOSH
And I was answering it.

RYAN
Incorrectly.

JOSH
You work for me, you don't correct me in front of the President.

RYAN
Even when you're giving him wrong information?

JOSH
Yes.

RYAN
Really?

Josh grabs a large book off the bookshelf and hands it to Ryan.

JOSH
Xerox this. Front to back, double-sided, and...

RYAN
Collated?

JOSH
Yeah. Go wild.

RYAN
All right.

Ryan walks off.

DONNA
Trouble in mind-numbing Presidential briefing paradise?

JOSH
Eve Harrington in penny loafers here just corrected me in front of the
President.

DONNA
Where you wrong?

JOSH
That's not the point.

DONNA
What is the point?

JOSH
I'm going into my office now.

DONNA
Senator Hunt's in there.

JOSH
Matt Hunt's in my office.

Josh walks into his office.

JOSH
Senator, sorry to keep you waiting.

HUNT
That's okay. You didn't know I was coming.

JOSH
What can I do for you?

HUNT
I, uh... I lost my temper yesterday with Leo McGarry. He accused me of some
things, I responded in kind. I want you to keep him from publicly supporting
Ken O'Neal.

Josh indicates for him to sit and they both do.

HUNT
Thanks.

JOSH
Senator, Leo doesn't take directions from me. I can't keep him from making
a breakfast order.

HUNT
I understand loyalty. There are men that I served with that I would do anything
for and they for me. But you can't let Leo get involved in this. You know
Mark Lofton?

JOSH
No.

HUNT
Until six weeks ago, he was a DoD procurement officer making $80,000 a
year. He supervised the bid process on the LC-104 Ramses. Now he's a senior
vice president of a major defense contractor making over $300,000 a year. Want
to guess who he works for?

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Bartlet, Alexander, McGill, and Barrow are standing near the screen.

ALEXANDER
The Sea Stallion's heading back to the Cowpens. He should be breaking radio
silence any moment.

BARTLET
Do we know if they've encountered any resistance?

MCGILL
Reconnaissance didn't see anything on their last flyover.

PILOT
Tigertail 1-1 to ODS, is this channel secure?

ODS ON COWPENS
Affirmative, Tigertail 1-1. Call in. Over.

MCGILL
That's ODS on the USS Cowpens.

PILOT
Tigertail 1-1 en route. Not to keep you in suspense ODS, all five pieces of
cargo were secured.

Everybody claps.

BARTLET
Commander, this is President Bartlet. What is their condition?

SEAL TEAM LEADER
Mr. President, this is SEAL Team Leader. Some bruised egos and a few broken
bones but all stable. Unfortunately, we lost a member of the SEAL team,
Captain Zeretsky, looks like hypoxia from the jump, sir.

ALEXANDER
Commander, any unfriendly encounters?

SEAL TEAM LEADER
Sir, no sir. Heavy water traffic on our way out from the beach, but they
were blind as bats.

BARTLET
Well done, Commander. Thank you.

SEAL TEAM LEADER
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
General, can you get me a number for Captain Zeretsky's family?

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Josh is walking to Leo's office. He looks very concerned. He walks into
Leo's office and speaks to Margaret, who is typing on her computer.

JOSH
Where is he?

MARGARET
Out of the building.

JOSH
Where out of the building?

MARGARET
Ken O'Neal called. Leo went to meet him.

Josh leaves.

CUT TO: EXT. - RIVERSIDE - DAY

Ken is standing by the riverside as Leo walks up.

LEO
I was worried about you.

O'NEAL
Sorry about lunch. I got held up with our General Counsel.

LEO
I talked to Hunt. I know a bit about what's going on. He's just trying to
score cheap political points off of our friendship. Get his face on the
cover of the Journal.

Leo's phone rings.

O'NEAL
Go ahead.

LEO
No. It's just Josh.

They sit down on a bench.

LEO
I'm sorry. I got you into this mess. He wouldn't be making rain out of it
if it weren't for me.

O'NEAL
No, it's not your fault, Leo.

LEO
I told him if he tried to drag you up in front of Armed Services he'd have
to haul me up there first.

O'NEAL
No.

LEO
All the times you've come in under budget, all the times you've delivered
projects on schedule under impossible deadlines...

O'NEAL
You can't testify.

LEO
If it comes to that, I can handle Hunt.

O'NEAL
You can't testify. I'm going to take the Fifth. I got the subpoena yesterday. I
spent the morning with my attorneys. I'm going to assert my Fifth-Amendment
right not to answer any questions.

LEO
Why?

O'NEAL
We didn't do the AOA. I gave a procurement officer at the DoD a job and I
got to a guy on the Defense Policy Board. [pause] Stop looking at me like that.

LEO
Why not do the AOA? The Army wants the choppers. What, they were going to
buy them from the French?

O'NEAL
We had to have the contract. I'm under a lot of pressure from my board. That
Hollander merger was a disaster and the Navy left us holding the bag on the
Warrior III missile system.

LEO
This was about money?

O'Neal gets up.

O'NEAL
I have a responsibility to my employees and to our stockholders. And, yes,
I pushed a little harder than I should have. And, yes, I'm going to hang for
it. But it wasn't just me. Who do you think was pushing me? My congressman
and my senator.

Leo gets up and stands by Ken.

O'NEAL [cont.]
This was a jobs bill for them. [pause] So I paid an advance to a procurement
officer I was planning on hiring. Do you think I was the first? It's a
revolving door between the Pentagon and the private sector.

LEO
How much did you make last year?

O'NEAL
What?

LEO
How much, Kenny?

O'NEAL
Mm... just over a million.

LEO
Nah. How much with bonuses?

O'NEAL
$11 million.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We hear Crosby, Stills and Nash singing My Country 'Tis of Thee. We pan
around to see Leo sitting in his chair. He has been and still is crying.

CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing

Land where my fathers died
Land of the Pilgrim's pride

Bartlet comes in from his office and sits next to Leo.

BARTLET
You okay?

LEO
Kenny did it.

BARTLET
Josh told me. [pause] We got the Hawkeye crew out. All five of them. We lost
one of the SEALs.

LEO
What's-what's this music?

BARTLET
Crosby, Stills and Nash came by. They're getting the National Medal for the
Arts; gave me this tape. It's beautiful, huh?

LEO
We were out in the jungle for three days. Kenny carried me on his back; hid
me under piles of leaves while he went to find us water. I was delirious,
I lost a lot of blood. He could have left me; He should have left me.

He begins crying again.

LEO [cont.]
He never did. We, uh, found a clearing where we could send up a flare and a
couple hours later these two Hueys showed up taking all kinds of AK fire. Men
died for us. We had a responsibility to live our lives with integrity and
honesty to honor their sacrifice.

BARTLET
[speaks Latin] Corruptio optimi pessima. 'Corruption of the best is the
worst.' You've done more, much more, all on your own to honor their sacrifice,
Leo. They'd be as proud to know you as I am.

Bartlet returns to his office.

CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring

CUT TO: EXT. - JUNGLE - DAY - FLASHBACK

We see Kenny and Leo near a tree and we hear the approach of a helicopter.

KENNY
Leo. Leo, come on. They're here. We're going home.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We see Leo sitting in his chair as he reflects.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
