DR. LEWIS FOY
Preliminary results indicate an alarmingly high prevalence of infection.

FADE IN: INT. - LAB - NIGHT
      JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
      MEDICAL RESEARCH LAB

A man, Dr. Lewis Foy, and a technician are seated at a lab table. They are
reviewing something.

FOY
U.S. rates are 14%, whereas of patient volunteers we investigated, 48%
tested positive for HPV.

The phone in Dr. Foy's office starts ringing.

FOY
Take a message. And bring me the PCR data as well.

The technician goes into the office and answers the phone.

TECHNICIAN
Dr. Foy's office. ... I'm sorry. Dr. Foy's not available. ... Hold on a sec.

He comes back into the lab and speaks to Dr. Foy.

TECHNICIAN
He's from Congressman Bentley's office, they're reviewing one of your
NIH grants.

Dr. Foy goes into the office and grabs the phone.

FOY
Thanks. [into phone] Lewis Foy. ... That's very nice. ... I'm sorry, which
congressman? ... Which project? ... Let me put you on speaker so I can find
my grants' file.

He turns on the speakerphone and hangs up the receiver.

MAN
The congressman is especially impressed with your work on, wait, I have it
right here, "the Human Papilloma Virus in Commercial Sex Workers in San Juan,
Puerto Rico."

He writes something on a piece of paper and hands it to the technician.

MAN
But why the interest in Puerto Rico? Why focus on sex workers? Is that really
of scientific value?

FOY
I just submitted my non-competing renewal and there are three years left on
my grant.

The technician has walked out of the room and over to the office area of
another scientist.

TECHNICIAN
Ellie, he needs you.

MAN
Can you confirm your home address?

FOY
How is that relevant?

MAN
The address we have is 536 Washburn Lane. Are you a registered voter,
sir? Our records indicate you're a registered Democrat.

FOY
I don't see how that's any of your business.

MAN
Can you tell me who you voted for?

As she walks off, we focus on the picture on her desk which shows Bartlet
and Abbey standing beside Ellie Bartlet, dressed in a graduation gown.

C.J. [prelap]
Maybe she's overreacting, maybe I'm overreacting.

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Toby is seated at his desk and C.J. is across from him and they are talking.

TOBY
Maybe.

C.J.
He never mentioned her. He never made reference to her working in the lab
at all.

TOBY
Okay.

C.J.
The old
let's-lift-up-this-rock-and-see-if-we-can-find-something-wiggling-underneath
game.

TOBY
Just happened to be her rock.

C.J.
She's so sensitive. You know she'd freak if anyone even hints at nepotism.

Toby stands up from his desk.

C.J.
Tell me this is nothing to worry about.

TOBY
This is nothing to worry about.

C.J. moves to leave.

C.J.
Toby.

TOBY
Which Congressman was it?

C.J.
Bentley.

TOBY
As in House Reform? How many U.S. Research Labs come equipped with the
President's daughter? Whether they invoked her or not, they wouldn't have
called unless they had something. Somebody's out for blood and they're
targeting Ellie Bartlet.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Carol and C.J. are walking and talking. They end up in C.J.'s office.

CAROL
Ben will be here at 1:00. I got the back table at 1789, and I told him to
wear the painter's pants so you won't be tempted to jump him. And he has a
meeting at 3:00.

C.J.
Nice work.

CAROL
Those would have to be some pretty hideous painter's pants.

C.J. goes into her office. Toby is sitting on the couch.

C.J.
Now that you've slept on it, the call to Dr. Foy wasn't about Ellie Bartlet
and I get to have a happy quiet day?

TOBY
Now that I've slept on it I think it's worse.

C.J.
When they were in the Governor's mansion, Ellie got $5 allowance for doing
a boat-load of chores. The President isn't steering money to his daughter.

TOBY
Not the President. Us. Some overeager NIH lackey trying to curry favor and
this whole conversation might be a little bit easier were I not fighting my
way through a cloud of Obsession.

C.J.
There's no cloud.

TOBY
It's about to precipitate out. It's about to rain Obsession.

C.J.
I got a brief.

TOBY
I'll get a breakdown of Foy's research funding.

C.J.
Hope like hell it hasn't gone up since Ellie Bartlet started working for him.

TOBY
I'll call Mike Raffer on the House Committee.

C.J.
Thank you.

TOBY
It's not about you. I'll do pretty much anything to avoid using the words
"Mr. President" and "your daughter" in the same sentence.

JOSH [prelap]
So what did you think of the...

CUT TO: INT. - OFFICE - DAY

Josh is talking with a man later identified as Eric Hayden.

JOSH [cont.]
... Lawrence opinion?

HAYDEN
You keeping track of the Court these days?

JOSH
While I'm not color-coding the President's M&amp;M's.

HAYDEN
You still smarting I had to carry your ass through con law?

JOSH
You did not carry...

HAYDEN
You thought strict-scrutiny was a pick-up technique.

JOSH
Hey, it worked on Pam Sussman.

Josh sees the look that Hayden is giving him which is one of disdain.

JOSH
I mean, not that well. How is your lovely wife?

HAYDEN
She's good.

They sit.

HAYDEN
So, Georgetown offered me dean of the law school.

JOSH
That's great, except aren't you a judicial nominee for the Sixth Circuit?

HAYDEN
I've been a judicial nominee for the Sixth Circuit for 12 months.

JOSH
You knew the confirmation process would be an uphill battle.

HAYDEN
Uphill battle? It's more like a permanent gag order. I can't write, I can't
publish. Hell, I can't even debate the cases with my students. Not to mention
I've had a bull's-eye painted on my back for 12 months. They've called my
wife, my brother, my ex-girlfriends.

JOSH
These things take time.

HAYDEN
Come on. The Republicans have been blocking your nominations since Bartlet
took office.

JOSH
You drop out, you're going to close this door forever.

HAYDEN
I'm not sure this door was ever open.

JOSH
When does Georgetown...

HAYDEN
Don't do this to me.

JOSH
When do they need to know?

HAYDEN
End of the week.

JOSH
Give me 'til then.

HAYDEN
To do what?

JOSH
To fix it.

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

Toby is seated at his desk when Rena comes in.

RENA
They said they'd call back.

TOBY
You told Congressman Bentley the White House was calling? Toby Ziegler from
the White House?

RENA
Maybe you're running out of shizzle. I looked up his funding on the NIH's
public website. The money for last year's the same as before Ellie Bartlet
started working - okay, $14 more. Maybe they gave him a new trash can.

TOBY
Try Bentley again and look into not-so-direct ways we could be sending money
in Dr. Foy's direction. And please don't say "shizzle".

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J. and Leo walk out of Leo's office and start walking down the hallway.

C.J.
Mrs. Bartlet ditched the Board of Regent's meeting? What, did you find her
smoking in the parking lot of the Smithsonian?

LEO
She was working at the clinic. And she sent a proxy, but Chairwoman Dorothea
Langston Lodge is hopping mad and threatening to go to the press.

C.J.
Hopping mad she had to go the Board of Regent's meeting.

LEO
We've got an image problem. The stories aren't dying down. The press doesn't
know what to do with the First Lady. Nobody does, including the President,
which is why he'd like you to sit down with her.

C.J.
Happy to help.

LEO
She's in the Mural Room.

C.J.
Now? I have a... had a lunch. I'm just going to go cancel it.

LEO
Are you wearing White Shoulders? My piano teacher used to wear White Shoulders.

C.J. walks off.

LEO
Not as much.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Carol is standing in her office and Ben is standing in C.J.'s office. We
see C.J. walk up and Carol makes sure she is ready to meet Ben. She walks
into her office.

C.J.
Hi.

BEN
Hi.

C.J.
Long time.

BEN
Yeah. You look great.

C.J.
You, too. I'm sorry, Ben, I can't have lunch. And I don't have a lot of
time. But... you did the dance. You paid your dues. I want you to know that
I'm in.

BEN
What?

C.J.
Coy is a bad color on me. I'm ready. I'm on board. I want you to count me
in because I'm in.

She kisses him.

C.J.
I got to go. Call me later.

She walks off.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh walks in and speaks to Donna, although she is on the phone.

JOSH
Did you get Leo?

DONNA
He's booked.

JOSH
Tell Margaret I can talk so fast it won't actually take measurable time.

DONNA
I'm waiting for Rodney.

JOSH
Who's Rodney?

DONNA
Ryan's roommate.

JOSH
Ryan's got a roommate?

DONNA
He's checking to see if Ryan's in his room because he didn't show up today
and it's not like him.

JOSH
Really? 'Cause it seems exactly like him.

DONNA
He's never late. He walks in like he's late, but he's not.

JOSH
Like when you're on a train and the train next to you is pulling away,
only it's like...

DONNA
I wonder if he went back to sleep.

JOSH
That, or he's dead now, too. Get me Leo.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - DAY

C.J. and Abbey are seated and they are talking.

ABBEY
So, what was it? Was it the tube top to meet the Queen of England or the
low rise jeans for the North Korean delegation?

C.J.
Mrs. Bartlet, the press didn't know what to make of you before the MS became
public. You've never been the traditional hat-knitting President's wife.

ABBEY
Oh, shoot. Was that in the handbook? Maybe just get me a photographer and
seven year's worth of yarn.

C.J.
Can you tell me why you decided to volunteer at the free clinic?

ABBEY
Because, instead of putting out a press release I decided to roll up my
sleeves and help treat children.

C.J.
Is there any particular...

ABBEY
There are any number of children's health issues I'm concerned with, so I
thought it was appropriate to go out and just see what was going on first-hand.

C.J.
Great. But until the press understands that, they're going to fill in the
blanks with self-aggrandizing, craven, vote-grabbing...

ABBEY
Would you like me to do interviews with the press corps?

C.J.
God, no! They're the most cynical bastards on the planet. You need to get
beyond the Washington echo chamber and speak directly to the people.

ABBEY
So, what did you have in mind?

C.J.
I checked out the reject list from your invitation file and there are a few
things in her I think you should reconsider: the first of which is Muppets.

ABBEY
Pardon.

C.J.
Going on Sesame Street would give you an opportunity to reintroduce yourself as
the First Lady who is also a working doctor and address the press's questions
about your work at the clinic. Give a muppet a checkup. Get your message out.

ABBEY
No Meet the Press?

C.J.
Mrs. Bartlet...

ABBEY
You don't think I could take Russert?

C.J.
Why should you? Only five people are watching and it's the toughest interview
on the planet. I want you on the Surgery channel, women's health magazines,
the Today Show. Mrs. Russell's ratings bumped considerably when she did her
cooking segment. Her chili was so good they're having her back for Christmas.

ABBEY
C.J., you're trying to raise my competitive hackles.

C.J.
Mrs. Bartlet, if I were trying to raise your competitive hackles, I'd make
you watch Diane Sawyer's duet with Cookie Monster.

ABBEY
Muppets.

JOSH
I want to set up a meeting...

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY

Josh and Leo are walking to Leo's office. They are talking.

JOSH [cont.]
... with the Judiciary Committee's chief of staff.

LEO
That's a productive use of your time.

JOSH
Eric Hayden's going to withdraw from the nomination process. Sixth Circuit's
got eight empty seats.

LEO
Empty for a year and a half.

JOSH
Because the Republican's have been holding up our nominations in committee.

LEO
What else is new?

JOSH
At least four of those nominees, including Hayden, would be confirmed in a
straight up or down vote if they got out of committee and onto the Senate
floor. Meanwhile, over in the judicial branch, the seven remaining judges on
the Sixth Circuit are completely overworked, and the number of cases keeps
growing. If Hayden withdraws...

LEO
You want to make him the "Justice Held Hostage" poster boy?

JOSH
I'm betting the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee don't. How can they
afford to block a qualified...

They walk out into Margaret's office.

LEO
They've been blocking our nominations since Roe. If a judge has half an opinion
on the right to privacy, it's grounds for killing the nomination. You think
you can just waltz in, knock on a few pipes and fix the plumbing?

JOSH
The Sixth Circuit...

LEO
It's one lousy appellate court.

JOSH
Eric Hayden and the eight empty seats epitomize the problem. You don't think
it's time to do something?

LEO
Lunatics. I'm surrounded by lunatics.

JOSH
I'm going to set up the meeting.

LEO
I've got ten bucks says you're banging your head against the sink.

JOSH
Twenty.

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

Toby is on the phone when the worker comes in.

TOBY
That's what I figured you'd say, Mike, but thanks for checking.

RENA
You're friend couldn't help?

TOBY
My friend's a Democrat, which means no one on House Reform who knows anything
talks to him. What do you got?

RENA
Bubkiss.I mean, unless Dr. Foy got some of the $2 billion earmarked for HIV
and AIDS research.

TOBY
Foy's funding didn't come from that money.

RENA
If this is the President's brand of favoritism, Dr. Foy should find himself
a new sugar daddy.

TOBY
Where's Bentley?

RENA
I tried him again. His assistant promised she'd have him call you as soon
as he gets off the floor.

TOBY
He's not on the floor. There's no more votes today.

He turns on the TV. BARBARA LAYTON is on the TV.

BARBARA LAYTON
... a field for scientific study. Now, if someone wants to do a study on
"Depression in Childless Lesbians", I can't stop them.

TOBY
It's Barbara Layton. And there's Bentley standing right next to her. Get C.J.

LAYTON
I have a list...

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J. is standing in front of her TV and she is watching the same thing that
Toby was watching.

LAYTON [cont.]
... of 255 projects supported by the Bartlet administration...

CAROL
C.J., it's Toby.

C.J.
Tell him I'm already watching.

LAYTON
Dr. Gloria Buezo, $1,788,000. Dr. Lewis Foy...

C.J.
Damn it.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Toby is walking through the lobby. C.J. joins him and walks with him.

C.J.
She has a list. She made a list. Didn't lists go out with Joe McCarthy and
hula-hoops? And haven't these 255 scientists had to go through a rigorous
review process before getting a dollar?

TOBY
They knew about Ellie. Bentley and Layton knew that if they questioned
Dr. Foy, Ellie would contact us and we'd come knocking hard and fast, and I
walked right into it. It's a full-frontal attack and Layton's not going to
stop until she gets her televised investigation.

C.J.
You think Layton doesn't care about science?

TOBY
She didn't have an opinion on artistic expression then and she helped
dismantle the NEA.

C.J.
Let's not even dignify it. Put out a neutral statement saying the White House
has no role in the NIH review process. Refer all questions to the National
Institutes of Health.

TOBY
We might want the fight. We've just got to find out what it is first. [louder]
Rena, get me a copy of that list.

RENA
I'm right here.

TOBY
Find out everything you can about the projects and the investigators. How
the list was put together.

RENA
Okay.

TOBY
Get on the NIH's website. Look for keywords that appear in the project title;
like "heroin", "men who sleep with men".

C.J.
They're coming after us.

TOBY
Yeah. We can't put our pieces on the board until we know what game we're
playing. Just don't do anything. Just don't say anything. We can't... we
don't want Ellie's name spilling out because we pressed the wrong button.

C.J.
If we don't respond, it'll look like we have no response. I'm going to need
a party line.

TOBY
I'll talk to Leo.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo and Toby are talking.

LEO
No, no, no. Not one of the daughters.

TOBY
They haven't involved Ellie yet.

LEO
You know what happens if the President finds out Ellie's being dragged into
a political tar pit: we won't be able to get him to focus on his breakfast
order because he'll be asking for the launch codes. What's C.J. think?

TOBY
That we should hang back with a neutral statement.

LEO
Hiding under the covers isn't going to work. Margaret! Set up a meeting with
Toby and Layton for tomorrow morning. Let's see if we can't negotiate our
way out.

TOBY
A meeting's a statement. Our guys will think we've caved, her folks will
crow. You know she's not sitting down unless she comes away with a pound
of flesh.

LEO
That's why I gave you until tomorrow morning.

MARGARET
The NSC principles are in the Sit Room.

LEO
Thanks. [to Toby] I'm sorry, but can we really justify spending $800,000 on
"A Bio-Cultural Approach to the Study of Female Sexual Fantasy and Genital
Arousal"?

Leo hands Toby a piece of paper as he is walking out.

TOBY
How can we afford not to?

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Debbie is seated at her desk. Abbey is sitting beside her. Charlie is also
present.

DEBBIE
And the President was wondering if you'll be joining him at the reception
for Congressman Scaia.

ABBEY
You bet.

DEBBIE
Mrs. Bartlet... people are talking and I was wondering if you could confirm...

ABBEY
Yes, Debbie. The Muppets are coming to our very own White House.

DEBBIE
I had the good fortune of seeing Judy Garland live at Carnegie Hall, but
Miss Piggy--here... it's just too much.

CHARLIE
Debbie's a big fan.

ABBEY
And your not?

CHARLIE
I'm crazy for Muppets. I'm just trying to act cool.

DEBBIE
Ma'am, will Fozzie Bear be in the house?

ABBEY
Interestingly, Fozzie and Miss Piggy aren't actually a part of the Sesame
Street gang. They're from The Muppet Show.

DEBBIE
And what about Kermit?

ABBEY
He is the only crossover.

DEBBIE
Oh.


CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh comes in and speaks to Donna, who is getting some coffee.

JOSH
Set me a meeting with the judiciary chief of staff.

DONNA
Lisa Wolfe?

JOSH
We're gonna put butts in seats. I'm packing the court.

DONNA
Because of Eric Hayden.

JOSH
Because of Eric Hayden, because the Sixth Circuit's in crisis, because the
judicial nomination process is a complete mess.

DONNA
Is this some kind of over-determined,
do-something-impossible-to-impress-the-guy-who-impressed-you-stole-your-girlfriend-in-law-school
kind of thing?

JOSH
He didn't steal my girlfriend. I thought Pam was cute, but when I saw she
had eyes for Hayden I bowed out like a gentleman. Also, there's nothing I
take more seriously than getting judges on the federal bench.

They walk into Josh's office.

DONNA
What about getting judges on the Supreme Court?

JOSH
You see, this is the problem. It's all about the Supreme Court. Nine guys
getting all the ink.

DONNA
Actually, it's seven guys and two highly-qualified female jurists.

JOSH
The Supreme Court sees 80 cases a year. These guys see close to 20,000. Circuit
courts make 99% of judge-made law.

DONNA
Oh, that is important. You should fix that. Ryan's still missing, by the way.

Donna walks out of the office.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Will comes into C.J.'s office to talk to her.

WILL
What do C.J. and Big Bird have in common?

C.J.
This'll be fun because no one's ever made a joke about me and Big Bird before.

WILL
Your heads are in Ohio and your feet are in  Florida.

C.J.
Wouldn't that make us not so much tall as crooked?

WILL
Oh. Maybe. Is this Layton thing going to stick?

C.J.
Too soon to tell.

WILL
It's hard to imagine she'll get any kind of traction. If I had a nickel for
every Republican demagogue bloviating about our pansy-assed priorities...

C.J.
They do like to bloviate.
WILL
I mean, isn't that what the floor is for? Anyway...

C.J.
Do you want insight into Layton? Toby's tangled with her.

WILL
No, I was just... Thanks.

He leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - OFFICE - DAY

Josh is talking with the judiciary chief of staff, LISA WOLFE.

LISA WOLFE
Josh.

JOSH
Hello, Lisa. Let's talk about the Sixth Circuit.

WOLFE
Not much to talk about.

JOSH
Court's got eight empty seats.

WOLFE
And not a single confirmable nominee.

JOSH
Really? Seems like Eric Hayden's good for 53 "yea" votes on the Senate floor.

WOLFE
That seems unlikely.

JOSH
So you heard he's planning to withdraw?

WOLFE
No. But it wouldn't surprise me.

JOSH
Surprised me. And I've got a feeling the American public's going to be
shocked when they hear what the committee's doing to the Sixth Circuit.

WOLFE
Protecting one of the most important courts in the land from being overrun
by the Green Party?

JOSH
Whoa, whoa. The Green Party?

WOLFE
Hayden gave a speech on gay rights five years ago in which he said the courts
should make sodomy laws unconstitutional.

JOSH
The court just made sodomy laws unconstitutional.

WOLFE
Yes. Let me tell you, our base was thrilled with that decision.

JOSH
The press is already writing stories about the state of affairs on the Sixth
Circuit. It's time to fix this thing. It's in both our interests.

WOLFE
Talk more.

JOSH
We start with Hayden.

WOLFE
And the Sixth Circuit.

JOSH
You guys show a little good faith we'll sit down, knock back a few beers,
see what we can do to fix the greater problem.

WOLFE
Okay. You want to convince the Republicans on the committee we're starting
anew, you're going to need some new nominees.

JOSH
Confirm Hayden and we'll discuss it.

She shakes her head.

JOSH
They're going to have to fill some of those seats eventually.

WOLFE
I don't think so.

JOSH
They can't hold out forever.

WOLFE
They can hold out for three years.

JOSH
They can't. It's half the court. For six months they've left half the seats
on the Sixth Circuit...

WOLFE
The Sixth Circuit? How about 15% of the federal bench?

JOSH
What?

WOLFE
120 vacant seats. 120 empty robes during the last Republican presidency. Didn't
hear Governor Bartlet complaining then. Do you think I like this? Do you think
I think this is the way our government should function? I'm a Republican
and I've spent every day of the past five years wondering whether judges
shouldn't be appointed by executive decree. It's a political process. You
want to fill the Sixth Circuit you've got to send us someone we can confirm.

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

Rena is sitting at her desk. Toby walks over and she hands him some papers.

RENA
The staff assistants in Layton's office were so happy to give me the list I
swear I heard a band playing. So, why should we be studying female sex-workers
at truck stops?

TOBY
What's the purpose of the study? To try to improve and protect the public's
health, scientists have a responsibility to study whatever they think will
lead them to answers.

RENA
And we have to pay for it?

TOBY
Yeah, if they're conducted ethically and have merit.

RENA
But you said scientist's...

TOBY
[reading] "Doesn't approve of HIV being spread through sexual contact. Drug
addicts have made bad personal choices." One congresswoman doesn't get to
appoint herself God. Anything else?

RENA
Yes. I did a Google search for all of those project titles and the same
website kept coming up.

They walk out into the Communications Office.

RENA
I'm sorry, so, I'm supposed to raise my kid on $650 a week and shell out
for research of safe injection practices among heroin users?

TOBY
Yes. You have a kid?

RENA
Yeah, I have a little girl.

Toby hits some buttons on the computer and a website comes up.

TOBY
The Traditional Values Alliance?

RENA
They represent a bunch of church groups.

TOBY
Yeah. Some 50,000 of them. It's the same list. Get me Mack McCall from the
Traditional Values Alliance on the phone, now.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is eating lunch and Josh is talking to him.

LEO
Where's my 20 bucks?

JOSH
How do you feel about executive decrees?

LEO
Love 'em. I'm making one. I want my money.

JOSH
Hold on there. I want to talk about recess appointments.

LEO
A recess appointment?

JOSH
Not just one. Eight of 'em. Every vacant seat on the Sixth Circuit.

LEO
Uh-huh, fork it over.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
The appointments are only going to last for nine months, then we got to
nominate these guys again and we're back to square one.

JOSH
It's not square one. We increase public awareness, we re-examine the process...

LEO
We have our own little Whiskey Rebellion on the floor of the Senate.

JOSH
In response to which we circulate a bio of every one of our new judges,
let the country decide who's in the right. If we're going to have a national
debate, it's got to be on our terms.

LEO
Somebody's going to ask if it's constitutional.

JOSH
Chief Justice Warren thought so.

LEO
Earl Warren approved?

JOSH
Earl Warren was one. Along with Brennan and Potter Stewart.

LEO
I'll run it up the flagpole.

JOSH
Here you go.

Josh goes to hand him the money, but snatches it away at the last minute.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Charlie and C.J. are walking along the hallway. They are talking.

C.J.
I don't know, Charlie, C.J. and Big Bird are so tall that what?

CHARLIE
When you do cartwheels...

C.J.
... we kick God in the chin. When we trip on a rock we hit our heads on the
moon, when we do push-ups we burn our backs on the sun.

CHARLIE
And you read the Tall Street Journal.

C.J.
Go away.

C.J. walks into Carol's office.

CAROL
Dems have scheduled special-order speeches in defense of pure science,
pro-family groups are coming to Layton's defense. There's a letter signed by
237 members of the National Academy of Science calling the list "Scientific
McCarthyism", and the head of the NIH just put out a statement.

C.J.
"I have order an immediate review of all relevant projects." Great.

C.J. walks into her office. Abbey is there.

ABBEY
There's a whole new world of Sesame Street since my girls were little. Gordon
and Susan have gotten married. Maria has a daughter that's almost grown.

C.J.
What about Bob?

We see Ben walk up to the door behind C.J.

ABBEY
Bob is still there, he looks fantastic. You have a handsome man in your
doorway.

C.J.
Carol.

CAROL
He really needed to talk to you.

Abbey walks around to introduce herself to Abbey.

ABBEY
Hello. I'm Abbey Bartlet.

BEN
Ben Dryer, ma'am.

ABBEY
Yes. But who are you to our C.J.?

BEN
That's an excellent question, Mrs. Bartlet.

C.J.
Would you excuse us a moment?

ABBEY
Nice to meet you.

They walk out to talk.

C.J.
Whatever this is, it isn't a good time.

BEN
What... what does that mean, 'You're in"?

C.J.
You... me... together.
BEN
We haven't seen each other in six years. We haven't slept together in
15. So, what, are we engaged? I have a daughter. I have an ex-wife. I have
and ex-wife's mother that I have to take care of. What, are we gonna have
kids? Because we should probably get cracking.

C.J.
I didn't...

BEN
Yeah.

Toby walks up.

TOBY
Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Sorry.

Toby pulls C.J. aside and Ben walks off.

TOBY
I just got off the phone with Mack McCall of the Traditional Values
Alliance. The $2 million earmarked for AIDS research is actually a
"pseudo-scientific slush-fund for the President's daughter."

C.J.
She doesn't work in HIV. They're kooks.

TOBY
With a press conference that's gonna get coverage on national TV.

C.J.
Oh, my God.

TOBY
And where is Ellie? The press is gonna be all over her.

C.J.
We've got about thirty minutes to keep her under wraps.

Toby picks up a nearby phone.

TOBY
Ron Butterfield.

C.J. walks toward Carol's office.

C.J.
Carol, get me the Washington bureau chief.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J. looks at the screen and sees a news story and that Ellie Bartlet is on
the TV.

C.J.
Toby.

She points to the TV. Toby sees the news story. C.J. looks at Abbey who has
also seen the story.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

We see on a TV screen a story about Ellie Bartlet.

REPORTER
Dr. Bartlet is, of course, the President's daughter, a post-doctoral fellow
at Johns Hopkins where she studies Human Papilloma Virus, or HPV, in Puerto
Rican sex workers...

We pan to the hallway to see C.J., Josh, and Toby walking and talking.

JOSH
So, she okay?

C.J.
The Secret Service was right there.

We hear Bartlet yelling very loudly from the Oval Office.

BARTLET [OS]
How is this possible?! This is my family! What the hell are you people
thinking?!

C.J.
Oh my.

TOBY
I'd yell, too.

They walk into the Outer Oval Office. Bartlet is still yelling, although we
can't hear what he is saying.

JOSH
How can the Traditional Values Alliance link AIDS money to what Ellie
does? Aren't AIDS and HPV different areas of research?


C.J.
They're both below the waist.

DEBBIE
HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that's been linked to cervical cancer.

BARTLET [OS]
AH, get them the hell in here!

Leo opens the door to the Oval Office.

LEO
Come on.

They walk in.

BARTLET
When the NIH was founded, the idea was simple: Identify the best research
as defined by scientists themselves. And now these people, who are not even
scientists, have answered all the questions before any science has been
done? Have you seen one of these grant applications? We're lucky Einstein
didn't have to fill one out or God knows what "E" would equal. [pause] So,
tell me what you're doing with yourselves, 'cause right now I feel like I
might as well let loose a bunch of buzzards in Ellie's apartment for all
the good you're doing me.

C.J.
We're pretty sure Layton's known about Ellie since the beginning, but she's
been covering her tracks by having Bentley call other researchers as well.

LEO
What do you propose?

TOBY
Let's just make a statement and call it what it is: "People who don't like
you using you daughter as a partisan pinata."

C.J.
I don't want to engage with them.

JOSH
We have to fight back.

C.J.
I'm not saying we shouldn't.

JOSH
The public's health is at stake. We're going to sit back and let moralistic
dogma replace scientific method? Penicillin, human genetics, Rogaine. These
were all discovered with no practical objective in mind.

TOBY
It's not about that.

C.J.
It is, Toby, cause that's what's on the table.

BARTLET
Let's get Layton over here. I'm not cooperating with any kind of
investigation. [to C.J.] And I want you to pull the passes of every White
House reporter who filed on this.

C.J.
Sir, I can only imagine how angry you must be.

BARTLET
Damn it! Ellie's never sought or accepted public office! She's not running
that lab, She's a research fellow! They can take all the shots they want at
me, but these people have to understand when they attack my family, there's
going to be consequences.

JOSH
Sir, if we punish the Congresswoman or the press, we make it more of a story.

TOBY
I think we can discredit Layton.

LEO
How's that?

TOBY
She got her hit list from a political action group whose other website is
"TheLordhateshomos.org."

Bartlet scoffs.

BARTLET
Ellie's never asked for anything. Hell, I had to beg her to come to my first
Inaugural Ball. She had some kind of exam. I talked to the professor, asked
him to reschedule it. I think she's still mad at me. Abbey and I have been
very clear: we won't use them, you can't, either. We've never even put the
girls on a White House Christmas card.

Abbey and Ellie walk in from the portico.

ELLIE
Dad, I'm sorry about all of this.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Toby and C.J. are walking. C.J. walks past Toby as though she might be mad
at him.

TOBY
What? I didn't support you?

C.J.
No, I'm just tired. I thought I'd have somewhere to go tonight other than
my office. I wore perfume.

TOBY
What happened with Ben?

C.J.
I wrecked it.

TOBY
Wow. Is that a record?

C.J.
Personal best.

TOBY
Did you like him?

C.J.
Yeah.

TOBY
Really?

C.J.
Yeah.

TOBY
Go fix it.

C.J.
Uh...

TOBY
It's all I've got.

Toby walks off.

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

Toby walks into the Communications office. Rena is standing at her desk and
Will is standing at Toby's door.

TOBY
Call Layton's office. Tell 'em I'm coming over right now. [to Will] You
need something?

WILL
How did Layton get the list?

TOBY
Russell gonna weigh in on "Scientific McCarthyism"?

WILL
No. I need to find out...

Toby gets his coat and puts it on.

TOBY
Now's not good.

RENA
Thanks, Julie, you rock. You're all set to see Layton. They're expecting
you any time.

TOBY
Please don't say "You rock."

CUT TO: EXT. - DC STREET - DAY

Josh and Hayden are walking along a street and they are talking.

JOSH
I didn't have much luck with the Judiciary Committee.

HAYDEN
I didn't expect you would.

JOSH
But the President is seriously considering a number of recess appointments.

HAYDEN
A number?

JOSH
You and the other seven nominees to the Sixth Circuit. It'll be bumpy,
but once the public sees your credentials, we're confident that...

HAYDEN
You think it'll give the President a nice lift in the polls?

JOSH
No. I mean, I'm sure it can't hurt, but that's...

HAYDEN
I can't be your martyr, Josh.

JOSH
I'm not asking.

HAYDEN
They didn't confirm me now, they're sure as hell not going to confirm me nine
months from now. You think Georgetown's just going to wait around? I've got
two kids, a wife, a mortgage.

JOSH
I'm just trying...

HAYDEN
You're trying to win. In my first semester at Harvard, one of my students
helped 30 retired steelworkers file a class-action suit, an action under
ERISA. They were old men, just struggling to get by because the mill refused
to award them their federally guaranteed pension. So six years later, ten
of the plaintiffs have passed on and the court still hasn't gotten to their
case. You throw dirt at them. They throw dirt at you. It's never going to stop!

JOSH
So you're just going to hide at Georgetown and complain about it? Let's do
something! We're firing a shot here. Maybe we won't win the war, but come on,
Hayden, you are one of the brightest guys I have ever known. You got nine
months. Let's show 'em what you can do.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY

Ellie is seated at the table and is working on her laptop. Bartlet walks in.

BARTLET
Hey.

ELLIE
Hey.

BARTLET
Did you know that patents and copyrights were invented to encourage private
patronage of science and technology? It didn't work, of course.

ELLIE
Maybe they should have thrown in a free football phone.

BARTLET
I'm really sorry about today.

ELLIE
Yeah, well, if I'd known I was going to be on TV I would have blow-dried.

BARTLET
There's always been tension between science and policy. You know, we used to
terrible things to you people because we were never ready to hear what you
had to say. I know of one guy they were ready to carve up with instruments of
torture because he had this silly idea that the Earth revolved around the sun.

ELLIE
If this is an object lesson about how scientists have it better today because
there's no Inquisition...

BARTLET
I enjoy talking about Galileo, and don't you start with me!

ELLIE
It's apocryphal, Dad. A story for tourists. If Galileo had muttered "It
still moves" after they made him recant his life's work, they would have
killed him on the spot, and I don't know why I let you do this to me! [pause]
I promised Dr. Foy I'd have this stuff to him by tonight.

BARTLET
He'll understand.

ELLIE
I hate that he has to. I don't want to ask him. I just want to go sit in my
office and look at my data. What?

BARTLET
I wish you could do that, too.

ELLIE
But I can't.

BARTLET
If you believe in what you're doing, you have to speak up.

She gets up and goes to the refrigerator.

ELLIE
Our work speaks for itself.

BARTLET
It's not enough. I'm sorry you had the misfortune to be born in this family,
but our business is politics.

ELLIE

Your business.

BARTLET
This whole thing started because I earmarked $2 billion dollars of the
federal research budget for HIV/AIDS research.

ELLIE
What does that have to do with...?

BARTLET
Just because you like what I earmarked doesn't mean I didn't politicize
science just like Barbara Layton's trying to do. This is the real world. My
enemies will never stop going after you. But if Dr. Foy is investigated,
you need to be right by his side. And C.J. can help you with a statement.

ELLIE
No.

BARTLET
When Galileo said "Eppur si muove", it meant that he would continue no matter
what to study and publish.

ELLIE
I get nosebleeds, Dad.

BARTLET
Even though he had to live under house arrest and write in secret.

ELLIE
I couldn't stand up to a damn book report! It's easy for Zoey and Liz. You
and Mom love the attention.

BARTLET
Science can't wall itself off from controversy. It has to live by it!

ELLIE
It's not me, Dad. It's not.

She walks back to the table and sits down.

CUT TO: INT. - CONGRESSWOMAN LAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY

Toby walks up to Layton's secretary's desk.  Layton is standing there.

LAYTON
[to secretary] It's a red letter day and I just happened to be here to
celebrate with you. Toby, hi.

TOBY
Congresswoman.

LAYTON
I'm sorry about the mess, but one of my assistants just had her thesis
published.

They walk into her office.

LAYTON
Please.

They sit.

LAYTON
Nobody wants to blow up the NIH here. I promise I won't even mention the
Supercollider.

TOBY
No, you guys pretty much took care of that one already.

LAYTON
I hope you will convey my deepest sympathy that the President's daughter
has been dragged into all of this.

TOBY
I'll do that. He'll be delighted to hear that we won't be seeing anything
about Ellie Bartlet in your fundraising materials.

LAYTON
It wasn't my decision for her to go work in a lab doing questionable research
on Uncle Sam's dime.

TOBY
And you decide what's questionable?

LAYTON
It's my job. I'm on the authorizing committee for that money. There's nothing
wrong with healthy scrutiny.

TOBY
Healthy scrutiny, not subjective attack. Your list isn't about priorities. It's
about imposing ideology and religious doctrine on the awarding of individual
scientific grants.

LAYTON
It's the taxpayers' money.

TOBY
Your disapproval of high-risk behaviour is justification for stifling the
research to reduce it?

LAYTON
I don't have a problem with homosexuals, or injection-drug users. But there
is only one pie, and we're talking about using $2 billion dollars of it on
the small percentage of the population with HIV, which will mean cutting
funding on Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, and diabetes, multiple sclerosis.

TOBY
Oh, good. The MS card. This doesn't have to be one or the other.

LAYTON
One in eight women will get breast cancer and at least 15% of those aren't
going to live five years after the diagnosis. Every dollar you spend on
studies of Puerto Rican sex workers is one that you take away from cancer
centers and clinical tests.

TOBY
You don't know that. You don't know where undirected research will lead. You're
not a scientist and neither are the members of the Traditional Values
Alliance. What are you doing in bed with these people?

LAYTON
No, I'm not.

TOBY
I spoke with Mack McCall.

LAYTON
Oh, Mack McCall will take credit for anything that will get his name in
the paper.

TOBY
You got your list from the Traditional Values Alliance.

LAYTON
I didn't.

TOBY
Your lists are identical.

LAYTON
There's a lot of people who care about this issue. A lot of prominent people,
on both sides of the aisle. You'd be surprised, Toby. [pause] It was nice
seeing you again.

She gets up and goes to her desk. Toby gets up and leaves.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

We see an exterior shot of the White House.

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATION'S OFFICE - DAY

We see Toby walking into his office. C.J. and Rena are waiting for him when
he gets there.

C.J.
I've got Muppets in, like, two minutes but I wanted to...

TOBY
Layton claims she didn't get her list from the Traditional Values Alliance.

C.J.
She didn't. Rena?

RENA
When I first checked Dr. Foy's research funding on the NIH website, it said
he had $14 more this year.

TOBY
Right... the trash can.

RENA
Right. But when Layton's list came out, the extra $14 weren't there. Now
there were other discrepancies between the two lists, but they were so small
I figured it was just human error.

TOBY
So, Layton's list is up-to-date and the TVA's list isn't?

C.J.
Which makes sense. It's a public website. Probably not updated regularly.

RENA
But the 14 bucks kept bugging me, so I checked Layton's list against our
internal, NIH generated...

C.J.
... very un-public list. And...

TOBY
And... they're the same?

RENA
Yeah. See? No trash can.

C.J.
Our list was put out two weeks ago. She couldn't have gotten that information
unless...

TOBY
... unless whoever put this list together works inside the administration.

C.J.
At first I thought it was Stephen James from HHS, because I know he hates
the President. And then I thought it was the passive-aggressive recycling
guy, and...

A look of certainty comes to Toby's face.

C.J.
You know who it is?

TOBY
Yeah.

He gets up and leaves. Carol walks up to the office as he is leaving.

CAROL
I have new pages.

C.J.
This is not what we agreed on.

CAROL
I think the First Lady had some strong ideas about her character.

CUT TO: INT. - OEOB - HALLWAY - DAY

Will and a woman are walking. As they come to a doorway, Will sees Toby
standing outside. He speaks to the woman.

WILL
I'll catch up.

She walks away.

TOBY
If I were the Vice President's Chief of Staff, gearing up for the next
campaign, I might be doing some thinking about our own weaknesses, trying
to imagine how-how our opposition might be viewing us, with regards to
say... health care spending priorities.

WILL
It was for my eyes only. No one here knew about it except me.

TOBY
Yeah, well, the experiment got out of the lab, huh?

WILL
You didn't do opposition research in the last campaign?

TOBY
That's what vaults are for.

WILL
I honestly have no idea how it got to the Congresswoman.

TOBY
Yeah?

WILL
I came to talk to you about it yesterday, but you threw me out.

TOBY
Maybe if you had started the conversation by saying, "I just outed the
President's daughter on national TV". That would've gotten my attention.

WILL
So, you must be happy. Maybe if I had stuck around, I wouldn't be making
amateur mistakes, committing career suicide.

TOBY
I don't give a damn if you left opposition research in a FAX, did you or
did you not willfully target the President's daughter?

WILL
Of course not.

TOBY
I'll take you at your word this was a mistake. Whatever the hell else you
want to do about it is your own business.

He walks away.

WILL
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

C.J. is sitting on a bench. We see Big Bird walk up and sit down beside
her. Several people walk by and stare at them. Finally, C.J. gets up and
leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - PREP ROOM - DAY

The Muppets and actors are getting ready for Abbey's show. Donna is speaking
to a green Muppet.

DONNA
I never do this. I'm a little nervous.

GREEN MUPPET
Don't be silly. Wow! You have beautiful hair.

DONNA
Oh, my God, that's so sweet. I actually need to get it cut, but thanks.

MUPPET
Oh.

We pan to see Ellie and Debbie standing in a doorway.


ELLIE

Is everything okay?


DEBBIE
It's just that I thought, well, Kermit was going to be here, but you know,
it's no big deal.


Ellie laughs.



DEBBIE
I didn't know you studied HPV.

ELLIE
Yeah.


DEBBIE
My sister died of cervical cancer.

ELLIE
I'm so sorry.


DEBBIE
She was 37. It was really fast. We didn't know then. Nobody knew it was
connected to HPV.

ELLIE
Yeah.

DEBBIE
I hear there's a vaccine coming.

ELLIE
Yeah, that's what we've been working on.

DEBBIE
Work harder.

Debbie walks off.

We see that Abbey is standing next to Elmo, who is sitting on a table.

ELMO
Boy, going to a doctor is not so bad after all. [he laughs] Oh, that tickles!

ABBEY
Okay, and one, two, three.

She taps his knee with a reflex hammer.

ELMO
Oh, that was fun. Do the other one.

ABBEY
Ok, Elmo. It's time for your vaccination and I'm going to give you a little
injection.

ELMO
But Mrs. Doctor Abbey, First Lady Doctor, will it hurt Elmo?

ABBEY
Well, maybe just a tiny little bit, but it's very important.

ELMO
Wait a minute. Didn't you give up your medical license?

Everybody laughs.

ELMO
Do you have a diploma you could show Elmo?

Everybody laughs some more.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is on the phone when Josh comes in. Leo indicates that he will be off soon.

LEO
Yeah. ... Let me know if there's anything I can do.

He hangs up the phone.

JOSH
Hayden's on board.

LEO
Hayden.

JOSH
I got him. He called Georgetown, he's ready to...

LEO
Yeah, we're gonna have to put that on hold. We just lost a Supreme Court
Justice...

JOSH
Lost?

LEO
Dead.

JOSH
Justice Ashland's dead?

LEO
Justice Brady. Owen Brady. Heart attack.

JOSH
What was he, 45?

LEO
52.

JOSH
Justice Brady. Republicans are gonna go nuts. I just saw him.

Margaret walks in.

MARGARET
Leo. You've got the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee on line three.

LEO
I'll take it.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - DAY

Several people, including Abbey, Debbie, and C.J., are watching Abbey's
show from earlier. C.J. walks over to talk to Abbey. While C.J. is talking
to Abbey, Ben walks in the door.

C.J.
You did well.

ABBEY
If there's any kind of firestorm, I promise I'll handle it.

C.J.
I know.

ABBEY
Your handsome man's back.

C.J. walks over to him.

C.J.
Thank you for coming back.

BEN
Thank you for calling.

Ellie walks up.

ELLIE
C.J., can you help me with something?

Ben sighs and C.J. kisses him on the cheek. She follows Ellie out of the room.

CUT TO: INT. - OEOB - HALLWAY - DAY

Will is walking down the hallway. He walks around the corner and into the
Vice President's secretary's office.

WILL
He in there?

SECRETARY
Go on in.

CUT TO: INT. - VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

We hear a knock at the door and Will comes in.

RUSSELL
What can I do for you, Will?

WILL
We have to talk about the NIH list. I, uh, told them I'm the only one who's
seen it. I thought the research would be useful. I thought it was a good idea.

RUSSELL
It was a good idea. I heard you played "Bad Cop-Bad Cop" with the entire
staff trying to find out who leaked it to Layton.

WILL
Doesn't one of your wife's charities have to do with breast cancer?

RUSSELL
The National Foundation.

WILL
Congresswoman Layton's on the board of that foundation, too. Isn't she?

RUSSELL
What's your point?

WILL
There may be speculation...

RUSSELL
My wife feels very strongly about this work.

WILL
Is it possible she may have shared her information with Barbara Layton?

RUSSELL
Barb? Yeah. It's possible.

WILL
You're going to need to tell the President, sir.

RUSSELL
Am I?

WILL
It's going to come out, sir. The list is all over town.

RUSSELL
Well, maybe that's not so bad. It wasn't my plan, but it might be a happy
accident. Just the thing we need to put a little distance between us and
them. I wouldn't worry about.

Russell gets up.

RUSSELL
I really wouldn't. That will be all.

WILL
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

Will leaves and we follow him down the hall.

ELLIE [prelap]
While money spent studying the brains of PCP users...

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Ellie is standing at the podium and she is giving a statement.

ELLIE [cont.]
... might seem to be taxpayer waste, this research led directly to the
discovery of the NMDA receptor.

CUT TO: INT. - OEOB - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

We see Will walking down the hall and we can hear Ellie's voice.

ELLIE [VO]
Science cannot exist in a vacuum. By nature it's an open enterprise,
strengthened by public scrutiny.

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ellie is still giving her statement.

ELLIE [cont.]
Openness is the basis of a free society. But when science is attacked on
ideological grounds, its integrity and usefulness are threatened.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bartlet and Abbey are watching Ellie's statement.

ELLIE [cont.]
Independent peer-reviewed research is the cornerstone of science in America. It
shouldn't be about the left or the right, but what works to keep people safe
and healthy. I believe all Americans...

CUT TO: INT. - OEOB - WILL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Will walks into his office and we can see Ellie giving her statement on the
TV. Will sets down at his desk and looks off, contemplating.

ELLIE [cont.]
... and all people everywhere, no matter who they are or how they live, deserve
research to improve their lives. Thomas Jefferson said, "We must not be afraid
to follow the truth wherever it may lead." Scientific truth ennobles us. It
tells us who we are, where we've been, and where we're going. I believe the
truth will only be found when all scientists are free to pursue it. Thank you.
