TEASER

FADE IN: INT. - PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - NIGHT

We open in the Presidential limo and we see that Bartlet and Kate are riding
back from Fitzwallace's house. Kate

HARPER
Admiral Fitzwallace told me when he was a kid his dad took him sailing on
the Long Island Sound. Scared the hell out of him, so he joined the Navy.

The phone rings. Kate answers it.

HARPER
Kate Harper.

She speaks to Bartlet.

HARPER
It's Leo.

BARTLET
Hello.

LEO [VO]
How's Gail?

BARTLET
Not great.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

We see Leo sitting at his desk and he is talking with Bartlet.

LEO
Sir, there's been an Israeli missile strike in Gaza City.

CUT TO: INT. - PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CONTINUOUS

BARTLET
I'm on my way.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Bartlet is on the phone with Chairman Farad.

BARTLET
Chairman Farad, I need you to do all you can to prevent retribution. ... No,
Mr. Chairman, we had nothing to do with it. ... No, sir, Israel did not
discuss the missile strike with us.

A cameraman comes in from the Oval Office.

CAMERAMAN
60 seconds.

BARTLET
Sir, you don't want to make this more difficult for us. We need access to the
site in Gaza. And I will urge the Israelis to hold off on the attacks. ... Most
strongly, sir. ... And to you, Mr. Chairman.

He hangs up the phone.

BARTLET
Somebody get me the Israeli Prime Minister.

HARPER
We're still trying to reach him. The ambassador's on her way.

BARTLET
We're their closest ally on the planet. You'd think they could pick up the
damn phone. Is that the statement?

They walk into the Oval Office where a camera crew is preparing for Bartlet's
speech. As Bartlet walks to his desk, Toby hands him the speech. Bartlet
goes behind the desk, places the speech on the desk, and begins reading.

BARTLET
We get anything from the FBI?

HARPER
I was just about to...

BARTLET
Go.

HARPER
Yes, sir.

CAMERAMAN
30 seconds, please.

Bartlet puts on his coat and begins marking the paper.

C.J.
Sir, Carol's circulating the draft already.

BARTLET
"Tyranny of terror"? "Death Mongers"? What is this? Tolkien?

TOBY
The stronger your language now, the more leeway...

BARTLET
I'm not saying it.

CAMERAMAN
10 seconds.

C.J.
I'm gonna try and put a hold on the draft.

She leaves.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
I'm fine.

CAMERAMAN
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

BARTLET
My fellow Americans, good evening. This morning we lost three distinguished
Americans in a despicable act of terror in the Middle East. I come before you
shocked and saddened by our loss, and angered as we all are at the tragedy
thrust upon us.

CUT TO: EXT. - BOMB SITE - GAZA - DAY

We see the FBI team is processing the explosion site and we can hear Bartlet
giving his address.

BARTLET [VO][cont.]
The search is underway for those responsible. I ask for your patience while
we hunt for answers.

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Donna is still asleep in her bed. Josh is watching Bartlet's address on
the television.

BARTLET [on TV][cont.]
And as we pray with those who grieve, let us resolve to search not only for
justice, but also for a just end to this senseless cycle of violence. Thank
you, goodnight...

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

We see Nancy watching the address on the television in the office. She is
waiting with ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SHIRA GALIT. They are waiting to see Bartlet.


BARTLET [on TV][cont.]
... and God bless America.

NANCY
He should be right here.

Bartlet and Leo come out of the Oval Office. Bartlet shakes hands with Galit
and heads into the Mural Room.

BARTLET
Ambassador Galit, I'm glad someone from your government could spare a moment.

They have arrived in the Mural Room.

BARTLET [cont.]
I'm asking for restraint. What the hell do you think you're doing?

ISRAELI AMBASSADOR SHIRA GALIT
This has nothing to do with you. We have been tracking this man for six months.

BARTLET
And you couldn't take three minutes to think through the ramifications?

GALIT

Ramifications? A terrorist responsible for dozens of Israeli deaths is dead.

BARTLET
As are 11 innocent civilians. This is inflammatory! It endangers our
investigation.

GALIT
Israeli intelligence is doing all they can.

BARTLET
Damn it, Shira, if I'm going to find the people behind this I need access
to the bomb site, access to evidence, and the cooperation of the Palestinian
Authority - three things I can't get if you keep firing missiles into Gaza!

GALIT
Mr. President, we received information on the whereabouts of a man responsible
for the repeated killing of our citizens. We had the specific location and
little time. Would you have done any differently?

Nancy walks in. She indicates something to Bartlet.

BARTLET
If you'll excuse me.

Bartlet and Leo walk into the Outer Oval Office where Kate is waiting to
talk to them.

HARPER
The FBI's received an anonymous tip through Israeli Intelligence. They found
bomb-making equipment in an apartment in Gaza.

BARTLET
And they think it's linked to the bombing of our CODEL?

HARPER
Yes, sir. They think they've located one of the men responsible for murdering
our people.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.
END TEASER.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY
      MONDAY MORNING
      MEMORIAL DAY

We see Carol walking through the doors and into the hallway. She is carrying a
stack of papers on her arm. We can hear a female news reporter with a story
about the President's speech.

FEMALE REPORTER
The President offered his condolences to the families of those brutally
murdered in Gaza. It was a strong speech, but I'm surprised the President
didn't raise the possibility of greater military...

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

We see Carol walking through the Communications office. We also see a TV is
on and a male reporter is reading a story about the bombing.

MALE REPORTER
I'm all for white roses and black veils, but the ending: "A just end to this
cycle of violence." Just what, exactly, was the President suggesting?

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

We see Carol walk into Toby's office and we see that his TV is on, this time
showing a Retired Army General who is speaking.

GENERAL
... Palestinian population, but whatever he says, he's got three or four
possible targets that he's considering.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY

We see Carol walking through the hallway. On the TV we now see images of
sailors in dress uniforms carrying a flag-draped coffin. A different female
reporter can be heard, although not seen, talking about Fitzwallace.

FEMALE REPORTER [VO]
... including the body of Admiral Percy Fitzwallace, who will be buried on
Wednesday, in Arlington.

CUT TO: INT. - PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Carol comes into the briefing room the back way and walks into the actual
briefing room. C.J. is briefing the press. They are much calmer this time
than they were in the previous episode.

MALE REPORTER
And President Bartlet's departures from the draft text, were those planned
or...

C.J.
...part of the standard vetting process for a speech of this importance.

MALE REPORTER
The cuts aren't reflective of the President's attitude on military response
in Gaza?

C.J.
The cuts are reflective of the fact that Toby Ziegler's never written a
five-minute speech in his life. John.

Carol walks up and hands C.J. a note.

JOHN
On the hill, they're talking about a congressional resolution in support of
swift military action.

C.J.
The President is meeting with the leadership this morning. I'm sure they'll
have a productive discussion.

CHRIS
C.J., I've got a report the FBI is working with the Palestinian Authority
security forces at the site of the bombing.

C.J.
The investigation's in Gaza, the Palestinians speak the language.

She reads the note silently.

C.J.
I have an announcement. James Holtman, a legal aide to Congressman DeSantos,
died earlier today of head and neck injuries sustained in yesterday's
bombing. He was 26 years old.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Kate, Hutchinson, Leo, Barrow, and Bartlet are sitting around the table.

HARPER
His name is Khalil Nasan. He's one of the founders of a splinter group of
the Khanjari Martyrs. He recently fled Gaza City, and the equipment in his
apartment bore trace elements of RDX.

LEO
The same stuff used on our Suburban.

BARTLET
Where is he now?

HARPER
The FBI has tracked Nasan to his headquarters in Khan Younis in Southern Gaza.

HUTCHINSON
Sir, there are several military options.

BARTLET
Any not mentioned on television this morning?

HUTCHINSON
We're focusing on two. A commando raid on Khan Younis gives us a chance to
bring Nasan in alive, but his organization is heavily armed, so there's
a substantial risk to our soldiers and the mission could fail. A missile
strike from the USS Carney carries a higher likelihood of success and zero
risk to U.S. military personnel.

BARTLET
And the risk to civilians?

HUTCHINSON
We launch the Tomahawks in the next four hours, we can minimize the collateral
damage.

BARTLET
The next four hours.

HARPER
In the middle of the day, the children are still in school...

BARTLET
Where exactly is this headquarters?

HUTCHINSON
It's located in an apartment complex, sir.

BARTLET
How many people are we talking about?

HUTCHINSON
We're still evaluating.

BARTLET
Ballpark it for me.

HARPER
In a daytime strike, we're liable to see 15 to 50 casualties, depending on
how the building collapses and whether fire from the primary target spreads
to adjacent buildings.

BARTLET
15 to 50.

HUTCHINSON
Sir, if we strike in the next four hours...

BARTLET
Now what are my other options?

HUTCHINSON
Sir, I'm sorry...

BARTLET
I'm not risking 50 innocent Palestinians lives and the stability of our
relationships over there to take this guy out, so I'm asking what are my
other options?

CUT TO: INT. - NEW HANPSHIRE GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FLASHBACK - DAY
      SIX YEARS EARLIER

Bartlet is talking with Leo and an Air Force General, whose name I do not know.

GENERAL
Sir?

BARTLET
What are my other options?

GENERAL
Leo?

LEO
You don't have any options, Mr. Governor.

GENERAL
The President's decided to follow Admiral Fitzwallace's recommendation. This
is just a courtesy briefing.

BARTLET
So you're telling me, with less three months left in office, the President
and Admiral Fitzwallace are going to saddle me with a war in the Philippines.

The general scoffs.

BARTLET
I've been President-Elect for 72 hours - the brass is already laughing at me.

LEO
It's a limited peacekeeping mission, sir.

GENERAL
Military training, helping the Filipinos with logistics, intelligence.

LEO
No more than 1,000 troops.

BARTLET
Which sounds like a lot to me, but since I don't have the vaguest idea...

GENERAL
Woodrow Wilson didn't know a battalion from a battery when he took office.

BARTLET
And he did a heck of a job with the Versailles Treaty.

GENERAL
Admiral Fitzwallace thought it might be... reassuring.

BARTLET
He did, did he?

LEO
Alan, thanks for coming up.

GENERAL
We'll start the full security briefings next week. Sir, congratulations again,
and good luck with the press conference tonight.

BARTLET
Thanks.

Alan leaves.

BARTLET
Admiral Fitzwallace: remind me to fire that guy.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

We see that Hutchinson, Kate, Leo, Barrow, and Bartlet are still seated
around the table, talking.

HUTCHINSON
We could ask the Israelis to go after the suspect.

LEO
We don't want them fighting our battles.

BARTLET
We don't want them fighting at all.

BARROW
There is a Palestinian Authority.

LEO
Chairman Farad?

HARPER
He's offered his assistance.

HUTCHINSON
You've got to be kidding.

HARPER
He's asked for the opportunity to arrest any suspects identified by the FBI.

HUTCHINSON
Sir, we share our intel with him, he's as likely as not to tip off the suspect.

HARPER
The Chairman has no love for Nasan's organization, and we can provide
incentives for his cooperation.

HUTCHINSON
Guns and bombs to fight the Israelis?

HARPER
International legitimacy; agreement to recognize him again as the sole
representative of the Palestinian people.

LEO
You really want to get back on the merry-go-round with this guy?

BARTLET
Let's see what he has to say.

He gets up. They all get up as well. Bartlet leaves.

HUTCHINSON
Leo?

LEO
Yeah.

Leo leaves, following Bartlet.

CUT TO: INT. - BASEMENT - DAY

Leo and Bartlet are walking toward the stairs and Leo is speaking.

LEO
You know the Israelis have already tried this.

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
Two years ago. They identified the men behind the discotheque bombing; gave
the intel to the Palestinians. The Chairman sat them in a corner, made them
write "I will not kill innocent children" 20 times and sent them home.

BARTLET
He won't treat us like the Israelis; we have the power to bring him back to
the table.

LEO
Sir, the country wants action.

BARTLET
I'm not saying it's camembert and wine, Leo. I'm saying it's what we got. Tell
Hutchinson to find a way to get Nasan without taking out a city block,
I'll launch the damn missile myself.

He walks up the stairs.

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Donna is laying in her bed. A nurse is standing next to her checking some
things on her IV stand. Donna wakes up and groans.

NURSE
Hi, there. Did you just wake up?

DONNA
My mouth is dry.

NURSE
Let me get you some water.

The nurse leaves and we can see that Josh is sitting in a chair by Donna's
bed. He gets up and comes to stand next to Donna.

JOSH
Hey.

DONNA
What happened to you?

JOSH
To me?

DONNA
You need to shave.

JOSH
I haven't... really had time.

DONNA
Uh, where am I?

JOSH
You're in Germany.

DONNA
It doesn't look like Germany.

JOSH
You're actually in a military...

The nurse comes in and hands Donna a glass of water.

NURSE
Here you go, honey.

DONNA
She's not German.

NURSE
This is true. Just squeeze that clicker if it hurts; it's a morphine drip. It's
going to take some time to orient yourself.

DONNA
He needs to shave.

NURSE
Wouldn't hurt. I'm just going to draw a little blood.

She pulls out a syringe and prepares to draw blood. At the sight of the
needle, Josh begins to look uneasy and the nurse notices it.

NURSE
If you need to step outside...

JOSH
I'm fine.

She places the needle in the IV and begins to draw the blood. When the blood
can be seen in the syringe, Josh looks as though he might get sick.

JOSH
Uh, I'll be right back.

He leaves the room as we see the nurse continue to draw the blood she needs.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY

Toby is in Josh's office looking for some things. Carol comes in.

CAROL
Did you find his notes on the speaker's...

Toby looks upset, as though he has been searching for awhile and cannot find
what he is looking for.

CAROL
I'll check Donna's files.

She goes out into Josh's bullpen area as Toby's phone begins to ring. Toby
answers it to see that it is Josh.

TOBY
Hey.

JOSH [VO]
Hey.

TOBY
How's she doing?

JOSH [VO]
About the same.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

Josh is walking down the hall and he is on the phone talking to Toby.

JOSH [cont.]
But she's awake at least. Kind of. What's going on there?

TOBY [VO]
Well, other than the legion of Congressmen parading into the Oval demanding
retribution...

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY [cont.]
... it's been pretty quiet.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
The end of his address...

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
It was an improv...

JOSH [VO]
The Europeans loved it.

TOBY
Yeah, so did the Times. 'Course, in about 15 minutes, every other editorial
page in the country will be calling for Hamlet to get off the dime.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
So what are we doing?

TOBY [VO]
Hang on, I'll put the Joint Chiefs on the line.

JOSH
Toby...

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
You really want State secrets on a collect call to the Rheinland.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
We could use code names.

TOBY [VO]
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
Listen, we've got to make a call on Camden Yards.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Huh?

TOBY [VO]
It's Memorial Day...

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY [cont.]
... he's scheduled to toss out the first pitch at Camden Yards.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Cancel it. No. Can't cancel it; it sends the wrong message. Ask for a moment
of silence. And Toby, he's got... you've got to take him out with gloves
and a ball.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
It's a six-foot toss from the stands - it's Little League.

JOSH [VO]
FDR threw from the stands...

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH [cont.]
...beamed one of his photographers in '37, extended the Depression another
four years.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is at his desk talking with Russell and Haffley.

HAFFLEY
Leo, I can't stress enough the importance of an immediate and forceful
response.

LEO
Mr. Speaker, we fully intend to...

HAFFLEY
Really? Because the President's speech...

Toby comes in.

LEO
We're making every effort to identify those responsible.

RUSSELL
Gentlemen, we shouldn't get caught up in politics. Whether it's the religious
right or the guys funded by the AIPAC lobby on our side of the aisle, Israel
is a black-and-white issue.

HAFFLEY
Exactly. There was little sympathy for the Palestinians before this incident.

TOBY
But a resolution on swift military action, now that sounds like a winner.

HAFFLEY
These lunatics are willing to sacrifice themselves, their children. The only
way to ensure the safety of this country is to respond in kind.

TOBY
In kind.

RUSSELL
What I think the Speaker is trying to say...

LEO
I got it, Bob.

HAFFLEY
Do you? We lost two Congressmen. I've got 200 members of my conference
screaming for Chairman Farad's head. There's an obvious course of action
here. And on that, we stand firmly behind the President. And Bob's
right. Politics aside, Leo, he's got to do this.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is on the phone with Chairman Farad. Kate is also in the room.

FARAD [VO]
I will do all in my power to help you bring this man to justice.

BARTLET
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FARAD [VO]
We will do our very best, Mr. President.

BARTLET
We need more than your best, sir.

MAN
You're disconnected, sir.

HARPER
If you want to apprehend Nasan without escalating the conflict... Of course,
the Chairman's consistently chosen violence over peace. He doesn't really
have the power to challenge Hamas. He's walked away from offers that would
have given his people a Palestinian state, and the Israelis aren't likely
to sit down to the negotiation table with him again. He's not the answer to
the greater problem. He may be the answer to this one.

Leo comes in from his office.

LEO
I wouldn't bet on it.

BARTLET
Things didn't go so well with the leadership? [pause] What?

LEO
A bus in Jerusalem. Another suicide bombing. 10 to 20 dead, over 100 wounded.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Toby and C.J. are walking down the hall and they are talking.

C.J.
We're getting creamed out there.

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
CNN's running a piece tonight on the President's last-minute edits to the
President's address.

TOBY
I take it they're not praising his sensible moderation.

C.J.
Not so much. What's happening on the Hill?

TOBY
They're putting the military action resolution to a vote tomorrow morning.

C.J.
It's going to pass?

TOBY
I'm hoping it's not unanimous. What do you think?

C.J.
The whole country's waiting for the President to carpet bomb Gaza. I think
it's a good sign he hasn't done it yet.

She walks away. Charlie walks up. He is carrying Bartlet's bullet-proof vest
for the ballgame.

CHARLIE
Hey, Toby.

TOBY
Hey. What's that?

CHARLIE
It's for the game tonight.

TOBY
Why does he need...?

CHARLIE
He wants to throw from the mound. Secret Service says he's got to wear
the vest.

TOBY
He wants to throw from the mound? Have you ever seen him throw a baseball?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

TOBY
I'm not sure he can throw 60 feet without the vest.

CHARLIE
It's actually longer when you factor in the vertical...

TOBY
We're going to have to... we're going to...

CHARLIE
I'm thinking pull out a couple of gloves and throw him in the vest sometime
between his call with the Palestinian Chairman and his meeting with the
Egyptian ambassador.

TOBY
Yeah. Perfect.

Charlie walks off.

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Josh is watching the television when Donna wakes up.

DONNA
What are you watching?

JOSH
Nothing.

He turns off the TV.

JOSH
How do you feel? They left a lunch tray earlier.

DONNA
I'm not hungry.

JOSH
German chocolate cake.

DONNA
Really, I'm kind of nauseous.

JOSH
Okay. Your mom's on the way to New York. She's going to catch the red-eye
tonight.

DONNA
How long are you staying?

JOSH
I don't know, I figured if I hang around long enough one of the nurses is
bound to give me a sponge bath.

DONNA
Leo doesn't need you to...

JOSH
I'm here as long as I need to be here. Jello?

Josh's phone rings he answers it.

DONNA
I don't want to talk to anybody.

JOSH
Okay. Hey, C.J.

C.J. [VO]
How is she?

JOSH
She's fine. I mean, she was singing tunes from My Fair Lady earlier,
CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J. is at her desk talking to Josh.

JOSH [VO]
... but it may just be the morphine.

C.J.
Can I talk to her?

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
We're actually at intermission right now.

C.J. [VO]
But she really is all right?

JOSH
I'm telling you, she's doing this whole Julie Andrews thing.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Have you seen the news?

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see that Josh has walked out into the hallway while on the phone with
C.J. Colin walks up with a bag over his shoulder, his coat on his arm,
and a bouquet of flowers in his hand.

COLIN
Donna Moss?

JOSH
Uh-huh.

C.J. [VO]
Do you think we need to do...?

JOSH
You need to come out fighting. Leak a force-depletion report and blueprints
for the invasion.

C.J. [VO]
Invasion?

Josh sees that Colin has come to Donna's bedside and lays the flowers at
Donna's feet.

JOSH
Okay, that may be...

Colin leans over and lightly kisses Donna. Josh looks as though he doesn't
know what to do.

C.J. [VO]
Josh? Josh?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is on the phone with Chairman Farad. Kate, Leo, and Barrow are in
the room.

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, when we agreed to work with you on our investigation...

FARAD [VO]
Yes, and I appreciate you trust.

BARTLET
We assumed your people... we trusted that you wouldn't do anything to make
that investigation more difficult.

FARAD [VO]
Our security team has been cooperating.

BARTLET
The Jerusalem bombing, Mr. Chairman.

FARAD [VO]
Five children slaughtered in the last Israeli missile strike. How am I to
keep my people from reacting?

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, I agreed to work with you despite the way my people are
reacting. You must control you people.

We hear, through the phone, hurried and loud speaking in Arabic.

BARTLET
What's going on? Is he still on the line?

HARPER
The connection's been lost.

BARTLET
Well, can we get him back on the damn phone?

HARPER
Sir...

BARTLET
Does he not understand I'm trying to help him here? Ian, can you get him
back on the phone?

BARROW
You may have some difficulty with that, sir. The Israeli Army has deployed 150
armored vehicles and 2 armed squadrons to the eastern section of Ramallah. Sir,
they've surrounded the Chairman's compound.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

We see Bartlet, Kate, Leo, and Barrow walking into the Situation Room.

BARTLET
Five minutes, I can't get these guys to keep their damn hands off each other.

HUTCHINSON
The Israeli Special Forces have created a perimeter around the
compound. They've cut off the electricity, the phone service...

BARTLET
We noticed.

HARPER
The Israelis have been eyeing a unilateral solution. They probably figure
now's a good time to take out the Chairman.

BARTLET
Neutralize?

HARPER
Cut him off. Prevent him from possibly orchestrating further bombings until
they finish building the security fence.

Someone hands Kate a piece of paper.

BARROW
Or they've decided to forcibly remove Farad from the territories.

BARTLET
Well, that would make it more difficult to work with him.

HARPER
Actually, Mr. President - the Palestinian security forces are refusing to
proceed into Khan Younis.

LEO
They're not going to arrest Nasan?

HARPER
They can't reach the Chairman, and without his approval they won't go in.

BARTLET
Mr. Secretary, where are we?

HUTCHINSON
We've been working on a third military option, sir: two FA-18s dropping
air-to-surface guided missiles. These are a third of the size of the
Tomahawks. The damage would be substantially less.

BARTLET
How many?

HUTCHINSON
30 casualties, maximum.

BARTLET
That's substantially less than 50?

CUT TO: INT. - NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE HOUSE - FLASHBACK - DAY

We see that Bartlet is leaning against the doorframe of the State house. Leo
walks over to him.

HUTCHINSON [VO]
Night has fallen in Gaza, sir. You're looking at an evening raid.

BARTLET [VO]
If we wait till tomorrow morning, when school starts?

HARPER [VO]
15 to 20.

LEO
Governor.

BARTLET
1,000 American kids.

LEO
Excuse me?

BARTLET
The soldiers heading off to the Philippines. He's sending them into a war zone.

LEO
It's a peacekeeping mission.

BARTLET
Yeah, training and logistics. And handing out chewing gum.

LEO
You're entitled to comment if you feel that strongly about it.

BARTLET
Some of them aren't coming back.

LEO
You get the best information, you consider all your options, you look at
the potential good... and you do what you think is right.

BARTLET
Yeah.

HARPER [VO]
Sir, U.S. action at this time could be seen as an implicit sanction of the
Israeli assault.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

We see that everyone is still seated around the table and talking.

LEO
Sir, Nasan's not likely to stay put. If we don't act now we will lose him.

HARPER
And if the U.S. engages in the same type of missile strikes the Israelis
commonly resort to, we may need to evacuate our embassies throughout the
region. We could destabilize moderate regimes in Jordan and Egypt...

LEO
Nasan's contributed to the murder of three senior government officials. We've
reduced the collateral damage numbers substantially.

HARPER
We act now, it's like taking out a Super Bowl spot for every Anti-American
terrorist network in the Middle East.

HUTCHINSON
Failure to act, especially in the Middle East...

LEO
That's appeasement.

BARTLET
Leo, this isn't 1938. We aren't fighting fascists with armies and tanks. It's
terror cells. An individual can take out a city with a briefcase of
plutonium. The FA-18s, they're still in position?

HUTCHINSON
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I want a full collateral damage assessment report for a daylight assault on
my desk within the hour.

Bartlet gets up and leaves. Everyone stands.

LEO
Thank you, sir.

Leo walks over to where Kate has sat back down.

LEO
What do you think you're doing?

HARPER
Excuse me?

LEO
We don't push agendas here.

HARPER
I don't believe I am.

LEO
He has a process. He likes to reflect, consider his options, but at the end
of the day when it's time to make a call, he's got to stay focused.

HARPER
I'm trying to give him the relevant information...

LEO
This isn't the UN. He's not the Secretary-General. He's President of the
United States, and our job is to make sure his priorities are clear. Today's
priority is not world peace.

He walks away, leaving Kate at her seat.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

We see Leo walking through the Oval Office. We pan out onto the portico
where Bartlet appears to be pacing. Leo walks out to talk with Bartlet.

LEO
Haffley wants to schedule another meeting.

BARTLET
He doesn't think we got it the first time?

LEO
I've got the assessment report for the FA-18 strike.

BARTLET
I've been on the phone for the last three hours and I've barely moved
the needle. I got the Israelis to agree to hold off raiding the compound,
but they say the Chairman is harboring terrorists and the refuse to pull
back. They Egyptians did me a nice Cassandra routine over tea and papyrus,
the Syrians were a ball of laughs, and the Saudis, oh, the Saudis had this
neat idea about forking over any terrorist suspects to the International
Criminal Court, but I don't know how I'm supposed to sell that one.

LEO
Sir... the FA-18 strike is a reasonable response.

BARTLET
Maybe in Yemen, Leo, but this is Gaza. The peace process, the stability of
the region - we need to think long term here.

LEO
The peace process? The Israelis handed the Chairman the deal of the century
in Taba five years ago - he started smuggling Katyusha rockets into Gaza on
fishing boats. There is no long-term. The Israelis are right: there is only
one way to bring stability to this region and we should be out there with
them digging ditches and putting up barbed wire.

BARTLET
The fence?

LEO
It's a realistic solution.

BARTLET
It's a land-grab.

LEO
There's no alternative! There is no partner for peace.

BARTLET
And you're going to find a moderate Palestinian leader after the Israelis
have swiped half the Jordan Valley? After the United States has taken out
15 to 20 innocent civilians in Gaza.

LEO
We're no longer a neutral arbitrator. We've got skin in the game. And when
the sun comes up in Gaza you're going to have to launch those planes.

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Josh is watching PALESTINIAN PRIME MINISTER MUKARAT on the television. Colin
is also in the room. Donna is asleep.

MUKARAT
And we condemn this aggression and we call on the rest of the world to stop
Israel from putting our beloved Chairman Farad in jeopardy. Bullets will
breed bullets. Violence will breed violence.

Colin begins grabbing his things as though he is preparing to leave.

COLIN
They do get it, you know. Despite the rhetoric. The Palestinians realize
if they've got any chance at real peace it's with you guys as brokers. Be
a shame to see that blown.

JOSH
So, you too spend a lot of time together?

COLIN
Uh... some.

JOSH
Pretty long flight from Gaza to Germany.

COLIN
Not really. Not as long as the flight from DC. Look, she didn't
mention... anything. You know, if this is going to be an issue...

JOSH
No. No issue.

We hear Donna groan as she wakes up.

COLIN
You all right.

DONNA
Where's the...

JOSH
The what?

DONNA
The morphine?

COLIN
Here.

Colin hands Donna the morphine clicker. She takes it and begins clicking it
several times.

JOSH
I think it only works the first time.

DONNA
You're leaving?

COLIN
Yeah, just for a little bit. But I shall return before first light. Don't
go anywhere.

He bends down and kisses Donna goodbye. He begins to leave.

COLIN
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah? Nice to meet you.

DONNA
Isn't he charming?

JOSH
Sure, in a bodice-ripping, Heathcliff-on-the-moor, I'm-too-sexy-for-my-camera
sort of way.

DONNA
Oh, Josh.

The door opens and a nurse brings in some flowers for Donna.

JOSH
More admirers.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
How many photographers did you meet over there?

DONNA
Who are they from?

Josh grabs the card and looks at it.

JOSH
Uh... Okay, this is sort of weird.

We see that the one side of the card is written in Arabic.

DONNA
What?

Josh flips the card and reads the note, this one written in English.

JOSH
"Wishes for a speedy recovery. Father of the Baker, Father of the Light..."

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Kate and Leo are walking into Leo's office. They are talking about the card
that Donna got.

LEO
"...Son of the Sword."

HARPER
The flowers sound like pomegranate, the national flower of Palestine, and
the names on the card are the English translations of Abu Faran, Abu Saran,
and Ibn Husam.

LEO
And we've heard of Manny, Moe, and Jack?

HARPER
They're the Palestinian Prime Minister's three sons.

LEO
Mukarat? And what's the Arabic?

HARPER
A date, a time, and a restaurant not far from the hospital in Landstuhl.

LEO
What the hell are we supposed to do there.

HARPER
Somebody has a message they couldn't phone in to State, somebody who knew
a senior aide with the ear of the President was in Germany.

LEO
A domestic policy aide who refers to Italy as "The one that looks like a boot."

HARPER
Who, consequently, doesn't draw much attention on the international scene.

LEO
Yeah, so what is this?

HARPER
Information about the bombing, a message from Prime Minister Mukarat regarding
the current situation.

LEO
I gotta call in the CIA Director?

HARPER
We'll put agents on it, but they've already picked the guy they want to
talk to.

CUT TO: INT. - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Josh is standing at the window and he is on the phone with Kate.

JOSH
You want me to have a secret meeting with the Son of the Sword?

DONNA
I must be high from the morphine.

JOSH
You know, stealth isn't exactly my strong suit.

DONNA
He's very clumsy.

HARPER [VO]
Josh, you're just sitting down with a guy and seeing what he has to say.

JOSH
Yeah, but technically, I'm going to be a...

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

HARPER
It's a diplomatic meeting.

JOSH [VO]
Do I need to carry a piece?

HARPER
Josh...

CUT TO: INT - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

JOSH
Why aren't you sending, I don't know, someone more like you?

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

HARPER
Because they didn't send me the flowers.

CUT TO: INT - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

JOSH
They sent Donna the flowers.

HARPER [VO]
Donna can't walk, and they were angling for you. If I send in a professional,
it'll probably just spook the guy.

JOSH
So to speak.

DONNA
Is this dangerous?

JOSH
No, it's a diplomatic meeting. It's not dangerous. Donna wants to know if
it's dangerous.

HARPER [VO]
You flew Lufthasna...

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

HARPER [cont.]
You've been wandering the streets alone - if someone wanted to kill you,
it would have happened already.

CUT TO: INT - DONNA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

JOSH
Yeah, that's not so reassuring.

HARPER [VO]
I'm sending someone from the embassy...

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

HARPER [cont.]
... and we'll have someone in the restaurant if you run into any trouble. Maybe
try to keep a low profile.

JOSH [VO]
Should I switch cabs?

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Charlie is seated at his desk, and Debbie at hers. Toby is pacing. We see
that Bartlet's vest for the game is lying on Charlie's desk.

DEBBIE
You wouldn't rather wait in your office.

TOBY
I enjoy your company.

DEBBIE
I enjoy a good slug of gin at lunch, but I've learned to do without.

Bartlet comes in from the Oval Office. He seems to be in a slightly sour
mood. He sees Toby is there.

BARTLET
What do you want?

TOBY
Uh, nothing.

DEBBIE
He's only been hovering here like a jaybird for the last 40 minutes.

He notices the bullet-proof vest sitting on Charlie's desk.

BARTLET
What's that?

CHARLIE
It's the vest for the game.

BARTLET
What's it doing here now?

TOBY
Sir, when you wear the vest, your throwing motion...

BARTLET
I've worn the damn thing before.

TOBY
Mr. President, you'll be on national TV. Millions of Americans will be
watching. Given their current state of mind, I'd rather not have you walk
into a stadium of 40,000 people and hang a curveball over the backstop.

CHARLIE
He's right, sir. Everyone agrees?

BARTLET
Everyone?

CHARLIE
Leo, Josh, your wife, the Notre Dame Athletic department.

BARTLET
You've got 15 minutes. Give me the vest.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAFE - GERMANY - NIGHT

We see Josh walk up to the waiter and speak with him.

WAITER
(speaks German)

JOSH
(speaks German)

WAITER
I speak English.

JOSH
Okay. Good. I'm... uh... I'm  meeting someone.

WAITER
Mr. Lyman?

JOSH
Yes.

WAITER
I can walk you to your table.

The waiter shows him in and takes him to a table where an Arabic man in a
leather jacket is already sitting. As soon as Josh sits down, the man gets
up and leaves. Josh takes out his cell phone and dials.

JOSH
Kate Harper, quickly.

CUT TO: INT. - ELEVATOR - DAY

Charlie, Toby, Bartlet and a Secret Service Agent are in the elevator on
the way to the Residence. Toby and Charlie have ball gloves in their hand,
and Toby is carrying a roll of tape.

TOBY
Harrison.

CHARLIE
Nope.

TOBY
McKinley.

CHARLIE
McKinley did throw the first pitch at a Senator's game, but only as Governor.

TOBY
Taft?

CHARLIE
First one to throw out the first pitch, William Howard Taft in 1910.

BARTLET
Well, I hope they made Fatty practice.

They walk out into the hallway of the Residence.

BARTLET
Here?

CHARLIE
We figured you'd rather not share this moment with history.

BARTLET
You don't think the China Room would be better?

Bartlet removes his jacket and dons the bullet-proof vest. Charlie takes a
glove and the ball and walks to the end of the hallway. Toby tears a piece
of tape off the roll and puts it down on the floor to indicate where Bartlet
is supposed to stand.

BARTLET
This has got to be one of the highlights.

TOBY
Remember to follow through, sir.

Toby hands him the ball. Bartlet positions himself on the tape where he
is supposed to stand. He winds up and throws the ball. It misses horribly,
hitting the floor, bouncing off two walls, and then rolling to where Charlie
is standing.

BARTLET
Not a word, Ziegler.

CUT TO: INT. - RESTAURANT - GERMANY - NIGHT

Josh is sitting at the table, on his cell phone, talking with Kate.

JOSH
A guy was sitting at the table. I sat down; he left.

HARPER [VO]
He's probably just checking to make sure you weren't followed.

JOSH
This is a diplomatic meeting.

HARPER [VO]
Yes.

JOSH
'Cause it's feeling a little Nick Danger.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

HARPER
Try to relax.

JOSH [VO]
You've got a guy here?

HARPER
Yes, Josh.

CUT TO: INT. - RESTAURANT - GERMANY - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Is it the guy with the toupee, 'cause he looks pretty obvious.

HARPER [VO]
Josh.

We see the man come back to the table and sit across from Josh.

JOSH
I got to go.

He hangs up.

JOSH
Hi.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - DAY

Bartlet is still practicing his throw for the ball game. He is standing much
closer to Charlie than the taped line, although he is still missing.

TOBY
Okay. That was better.

BARTLET
I hit the wall.


TOBY
Distance was good. Now just try to aim for the guy with the mitt.

BARTLET
Why didn't we cancel?

CHARLIE
I was just wondering the same thing.

TOBY
I could write a hundred speeches, and we'd never come close to the sight of
you up on that mound.

BARTLET
Yeah, that's me: all-powerful; bending the will of the world by my mere
presence.

He throws the ball; it hits a wall and then bounces off and knocks over a lamp.

TOBY
Wow.

CUT TO: INT. - RESTAURANT - GERMANY - NIGHT

Josh is meeting with the Arab man.

MAN
Hamas grows stronger every day.

JOSH
Because of frustration with Israel.

MAN
Yes, but even more because of what Hamas can offer the Palestinian
people. Food, education, health care.

JOSH
But doesn't the Palestinian Authority...

MAN
The Palestinian Authority lines its own pockets. Chairman Farad cannot... will
not change, and he's willing to pull the temple down on his head. But there are
other, more reasonable men, who with help could affect change, challenge Hamas.

JOSH
Moderates.

MAN
I tell you this in the strictest of confidence. I bring word from Prime
Minister Mukarat of Palestine. He is concerned with the ongoing situation,
and he feels the time has come for opening a new line of dialogue with Israel
and your country; a line of dialogue that does not include Chairman Farad.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is asleep on his couch. Abbey walks up and places her hand on his shoulder
to wake him.

ABBEY
Leo? You all right?

LEO
Abbey. What can I do for you?

ABBEY
I came to offer up my services.

LEO
Your services?

ABBEY
I look pretty good in a bullet-proof vest.

LEO
Okay.

ABBEY
Not to mention I was quite the intramural softball player in my day. And,
let's face it, Jed's no Cy Young.

LEO
Toby and Josh think it's important he go out there tonight.

ABBEY
What does Ron Butterfield think?

LEO
We've had a dozen Secret Service guys at Camden Yards for the past two weeks
disassembling the air conditions. They'll have men in every janitor's closet,
every bathroom, up on the roof. Add in the 240 security guys the ballpark...

ABBEY
Okay. [pause] You look tired.

He nods his head.

LEO
It's been a long day.

ABBEY
It's been a long year. You want him to do something.

LEO
Yeah.

ABBEY
Seems to me he's trying to.

LEO
He's tilting at windmills.

ABBEY
Tilting at windmills in the Middle East. Is there a better place for that?

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - DAY

Bartlet is still practicing his throw for the ballgame. He is now throwing
much better and from the appropriate position.

BARTLET
You think historians will judge me because I can't stand the national
pass-time?

TOBY
We make sure it's a very well kept secret.

BARTLET
Yeah, but in 50, 60 years, some guy with a camcorder will track down some old
codger who used to work here on the kitchen staff and he'll tell the story of
how I thought Stan Musial was a pediatrician in Abbey's medical school class.

CHARLIE
It's a pretty common mistake.

BARTLET
I'd really like to bomb the whole damn place.

TOBY
Gaza?

BARTLET
Gaza, the West Bank. Take out the whole Arabian Peninsula while we're at it.

Bartlet begins to throw with more fervor as he begins to show his frustration
over the current situation.

TOBY
It's what the country wants.

BARTLET
Sure. Hell, it's practically the American way. And who cares if it's exactly
what those lunatics want. They push, we push back, and they've got the
holy war they've been praying for with a thousand and one recruits to take
the fight to the big kid on the other side of the Atlantic. It's like bad
Shakespeare. And they're just waiting for me to play my role and chuck a
big fat one right down the middle.

Leo and Kate walk in.

LEO
Mr. President.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet, Kate, and Leo walk into the Oval Office from the portico.

BARTLET
Let me get this straight: Josh met with some guy over bratwurst...?

HARPER
The information from his contact checks out. This has all the hallmarks of
a back-channel overture.

BARTLET
I thought Prime Minister Mukarat was in the Chairman's pocket.

HARPER
So did we. Seems he realizes unilateral Israeli action will leave his people
with less land than they'll get negotiating.

LEO
We're talking about king-making.

HARPER
We're talking about separation from a leader with whom there can be no
peace. The Israelis won't even sit down with Farad.

BARTLET
How would this work?

HARPER
We broker secret talks with the Israelis, show them Mukarat's credible,
they pull back, take steps to bolster Mukarat by releasing prisoners...

LEO
We're grasping at straws here. This kind of intervention into Palestinian
politics...

HARPER
American intervention is responsible for propping up nearly every dictator
in the Middle East.

LEO
And look where that's gotten us. Sir, it's time to focus on the terrorist
elements who have declared war against us.

HARPER
We're at war with the plague of jealousy and hatred and the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is the index patient. Shouldn't that be our focus?

BARTLET
Do we have any files on Mukarat? Writings, personal history?

HARPER
We could try to pull that together for you.

CUT TO: INT. - NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Bartlet and Leo are preparing for his press conference.

LEO
Governor, only you would decide to hold a press conference outside in
zero-degree weather. We'll all freeze.

BARTLET
One way to avoid too many questions.

LEO
I'd prefer to avoid hypothermia.

BARTLET
I'm going to get clobbered out there.

LEO
You're not going to get clobbered.

BARTLET
Maybe we should ask for a recount.

LEO
You got 303 electoral votes; I think you're stuck with them.

They see that there is a large crowd gather outside, waiting for the press
conference.

BARTLET
Who are all those people?

LEO
The press conference was no secret. Apparently you have fans.

BARTLET
What do they want me to do, run the country?

LEO
It's a little surprising, isn't it?

BARTLET
You heard me today. Hell, the General could barely keep his lunch down. You
don't think he and Fitzwallace are going to have a laugh about that?

LEO
We have some things to learn.

BARTLET
I can't do this without you.

LEO
You think I'd let you? There's a reason I stayed sober.

BARTLET [VO]
Is there any way to gauge the reaction of the Arab world? Of the Israelis?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is still talking with Leo and Kate.

HARPER
We have a number of contacts we could reach out to quietly.

BARTLET
Let's do so. And... keep the FA-18s on ready-alert.

Kate leaves the office.

LEO
Sir... this is a waste of time. We've tried elevating moderate...

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
You need to...

BARTLET
Thank you.

Bartlet walks around to the window as Leo leaves into his office.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL HALLWAY - GERMANY - NIGHT

We see Josh walking down the hall with flowers in his hand. He walks into
Donna's room and as he does, we pan down where we can see the floor where
Donna's bed was. We see several items including blankets, pillows, and other
bloodstained items are laying on the floor. Josh looks immediately worried
as he runs out of the room and around the corner to the nurses' station. He
speaks to one of the nurses there.

JOSH
Where's Donna Moss?

NURSE
Excuse me?

JOSH
Donna Moss. She's not in her room. Where is she?

NURSE
Are you a relative?

JOSH
I work for the President of the United States; I have the diplomatic rank
of a three-star general; tell me where Donna Moss is.

CUT TO: INT. - CAMDEN YARDS - STADIUM - NIGHT

We see Bartlet, Leo, Kate, and several Secret Service men walk into the
hallway of the stadium.

BARTLET
You spoke with Ambassador Galit?

HARPER
The Israelis are willing to sit down with Mukarat privately as long as we
can assure Chairman Farad won't be involved in any way.

BARTLET
OK. Where are you on this?

HARPER
Both options have risks.

BARTLET
Yeah. Give us a minute.

CUT TO: INT. - HOSPITAL - GERMANY - NIGHT

We see Josh rush through a door into the OR area. He looks in windows and
continues, hurrying, trying to find Donna. He finally finds where she is
and Col. Leahy is about to enter the OR.

LEAHY
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't go in there.

JOSH
What's...?

LEAHY
There's been a complication. She developed a pulmonary embolism. It's a
blood clot.

JOSH [simultaneous]
A blood clot.

LEAHY
We're trying to remove it now.

He goes in, leaving Josh outside.

CUT TO: INT. - CAMDEN YARDS - NIGHT

Bartlet is getting ready for the game. Leo is talking to him.

LEO
You know on May 13, the day before Israeli Independence Day, the TV stations
screen the name of every soldier who has fallen for the country. A name flashes
on the screen for a second or two, then the next name appears. You go to bed,
you get up, the names are still flashing. It takes 24 hours. That's how they
observe Memorial Day.

BARTLET
Yeah, and they keep firing missiles into Gaza, we start encouraging it,
how long until that broadcast last 48 hours? Or 72?

LEO
How many times have we tried negotiating

BARTLET
We're not negotiating with the Chairman.

LEO
Your priority should be the security of this country. I think you're gun-shy,
sir. The most important moment of your Presidency and you're going to blow
it because you're human. You're a father who almost lost his...

BARTLET
You think this is about Zoey? You're damn right it's about Zoey, and Ellie,
and Elizabeth and Mallory. It's about bombs in Penn's Station, in Macy's,
in Starbucks. Bombing Gaza could be the most dangerous move this country
has made in two centuries.

LEO
Or not.

BARTLET
In 75 years we'll know whether we're right or wrong, but no one standing here
today can tell me that with any certainty. I'm the one in the office. I'll
be the one who's judged.

CUT TO: INT. - NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

BARTLET
You hear me? It should be you Leo. You, not me.

Leo smiles as Bartlet walks outside to the press conference.

CUT TO: INT. - CAMDEN YARDS - NIGHT

We see Bartlet walk out toward the field. There is a Secret Service agent
who hands Bartlet a ball glove.

BARTLET
You got the ball?

Leo's phone rings. He answers it.

LEO
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Toby is in his office, on the phone with Leo. C.J. is also in the room.

TOBY
The Chairman's on TV, he's thanking us for inviting him to the negotiations.


LEO [VO]
What?!

TOBY
Chairman Farad - he's on TV, he's thanking us for inviting him...

CUT TO: INT. - CAMDEN YARDS - CONTINUOUS

TOBY [cont.][VO]
... and Prime Minister Mukarat to a summit with the Israelis.

LEO
We didn't invite him! We haven't even formally invited Mukarat!

TOBY [VO]
He's publicly accepted our invitation to Camp David.

ANNOUNCER
Tonight, we are pleased to welcome the President of the United States.

Bartlet begins walking out onto the field.

CUT TO: INT. - NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE HOUSE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

We see Bartlet turn as he is headed out to the press conference. Leo puts
his arm across his chest in a type of salute. Bartlet smiles.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAMDEN YARDS - FIELDS - NIGHT

We see Bartlet walk out to the pitcher's mound, waving and smiling as he
goes. He gets to the mound and waves some more to the cheering crowd as
he prepares to throw. We see that he is very concerned, and we can see the
tension on his face as we see him take the ball, wind up, and throw. We hear
the ball thwack in the mitt as we...

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
