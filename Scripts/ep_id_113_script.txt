TEASER

FADE IN: EXT.  CEMETERY  DAY

We open on a shot of the back door of a hearse. We see a Navy officer open
the door and stand at attention. We see an American flag draped over the
coffin. We next see, from inside the hearse, that several sailors are lined
up at the back of the hearse. A sailor reaches forward, grabs the coffin,
and pulls it out for the other sailors to grab hold of it. We see the sailors
lift the coffin, turn, and begin carrying the coffin to the grave as the
Navy officer shuts the hearse door.

CUT TO: EXT.  ROAD  DAY

We see the Presidential motorcade driving down the road.

CUT TO: INT.  LIMO  DAY

Bartlet is seated inside with Abbey, Kate and Leo.

KATE
We can't let the Chairman bully us into having a summit, sir.

BARTLET
Who's going to know?

LEO
People at State know; at the Pentagon.

KATE
And the Israelis know. IF we try to force them into hosting a summit they
may leak it.

ABBEY
That's so bad? The Chairman wants a peace summit. Isn't that a start?

KATE
He invited himself to Camp David. What's he going to do next, raid the icebox
at the Council of Foreign Relations?

LEO
Sir, we need to focus on military action; retaliation for the deaths of our
people in Gaza.

BARTLET
I've got a guy who says he wants to come to a peace table and I've got a table.

LEO
Tell Farad he can have his summit if it can double as his retirement
party. I'll spring for the watch.

BARTLET
What do I need from him to get the Israelis to Camp David?

KATE
He'd have to promise to arrest the leaders of Hamas, put the Palestinian
security services under Mukarat and the moderates, and adopt a new PLO
charter that gives up that portion of historical  Palestine he's going to
recognize as Israel.

ABBEY
Plus the watch?

CUT TO: EXT.  FUNERAL  DAY

We see the President's limo pull up outside the site of Admiral Fitzwallace's
funeral. A secret service agent opens the door and Bartlet gets out. He gives
Abbey a hand and she gets out. Charlie is waiting for them when they get out.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, this way, please.

Kate and then Leo get out of the limo.

KATE
Sir. I feel as if my council is largely responsible for this mess.

BARTLET
I get lots of council, Ms. Harper. What I choose to do with it is my
responsibility.

They walk away, toward the funeral.

CUT TO: EXT.  FRONT DOOR  WHITE HOUSE  DAY

We see Carol come out of the White House to meet C.J. as she is coming in.

CAROL
Ted Harper called from 60 Minutes, says he's got a Congressional widow on
camera demanding the President avenge her husband's death.

C.J.
Which one?

CUT TO: INT.  WHITE HOUSE  CONTINUOUS

We see C.J. and Carol walking in and they are still talking.

CAROL
Tom Korb's. They're hoping the President will go on camera to respond.

C.J.
And what? Defend his tie-died, hippie dippie, blowin'-in-the-wind, peacenik
pipe-dream while the grieving widow rends her garments?

They walk into an office of sorts.

CAROL
You want me to see if I can get you a couple minutes in the Oval right away?

C.J.
I thought the President won't be back in the building until this afternoon.

She grabs some papers from a table and leaves. As she does, we focus on the
TV which is broadcasting Chairman Farad's address.

CUT TO: INT.  JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA  DAY

We see C.J. and Will walking and they are talking.

WILL
The Israelis won't get in a room with Farad again. I'm surprised the Prime
Minister hasn't already said so in about three different languages.

C.J.
The President asked him not to.

WILL
Farad doesn't want to deal. Last time Israel offered up Gaza, 96% of the
West Bank, half of Jerusalem, sovereignty over the Temple Mount, and the
lead role in the Temple Bethel Koram play. He walked away.

C.J.
What do you need, Will?

WILL
The President should prepare to respond to the murder of two Congressmen. The
Vice President can't support the President on this.

They walk into C.J.'s office.

C.J.
Is he planning on saying so publicly?

WILL
He's speaking at the Israel Policy Forum Gala on Friday. I think it might
come up.

C.J.
He can't be convinced to come down with a nasty bout of the flu?

WILL
He's a pretty healthy guy.

He begins to leave the office but turns around.

WILL
The President knows, right? You guys are telling him?

C.J.
Knows what?

WILL
That there is no viable alternative. He's going to have to bomb Palestinians.

CUT TO: INT.  FUNERAL  DAY

We see the casket sitting in the church. Bartlet is giving a eulogy.

BARTLET
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are they
which are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs will be the Kingdom
of Heaven.


We see several people in the audience who are listening to Bartlet's eulogy.

BARTLET
And blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT.  SITUATION ROOM  DAY

We see several people around the table including Bartlet, Leo, Kate, Alexander,
and another man, called GEORGE.

ALEXANDER
We have no choice but to retaliate.

LEO
Khalil Nasan is still in Gaza?

GEORGE
Yes, but we've been able to link Nasan's bombing of our Congressional
delegation to the Khanjari Martyrs. And the Martyrs are using the Ein Hawa
camp near Damascus as their base of operations.

BARTLET
In Syria?

GEORGE
E-mail and cellular communications indicate that they supplied the munitions
and the technical support for Nasan.

LEO
What are you proposing, General?

ALEXANDER
Syria and Iran are the primary supporters of the Martyrs. The Lincoln battle
group is moving into strike range. We can use Slammer missiles against the Ein
Hawa camp and the two terrorist training camps in norther Iran, east of Birjan.

KATE
And blow the summit out of the water.

GEORGE
Oh, what summit? The Israelis aren't going to meet with Farad.

KATE
The region's already a powder keg.

LEO
Name one day in the last 20 centuries when it wasn't.

KATE
Egypt, Jordan, and the Saudis will help us craft a deal with Farad if they
think it's fair. But the whole thing will fall apart if we start bombing
Syria and Iran.

LEO
The only way to prevent attacks against Americans abroad is to show we're
willing to respond when provoked.

ALEXANDER
Bombing Syria and Iran sends a powerful message, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Do we have any evidence linking Iran to Nasan?

GEORGE
If we take this opportunity to strike Iranian terrorist camps, believe me,
sir, we'll find a way to link the attacks on our people back to them later.

BARTLET
Are you suggesting we use the attack on our Congressional delegation as a
pretext to attack another country we don't know to be responsible?

GEORGE
Sir, I'm not suggesting that, but it's clear...

BARTLET
Then what the hell are you suggesting?

LEO
Mr. President.

GEORGE
There's ample intelligence to indicate...

BARTLET
I'm not using Admiral Fitzwallace's death and the death of our Congressmen
as a pretext to attack another country we don't happen to like.

LEO
The Ambassador is here.

BARTLET
I want to see what we have linking Nasan to the Martyrs in Syria.

He stands up. Everyone else stands as well.

BARTLET
And if you come up with any credible, verifiable evidence dragging Iran into
this mess, I'll take a look at that, too.

He puts on his coat and leaves.

CUT TO: INT.  HALLWAY  BASEMENT  WHITE HOUSE  DAY

We see Bartlet and Leo walking away from the Sit Room.

BARTLET
I'm not bombing half the Middle East just because it's going to make us all
feel better.

LEO
They're on your side.

BARTLET
Really? I was having a hard time believing that a few minutes ago.

LEO
Sir, you can't delay any longer. There are no rabbits left in this hat.

BARTLET
I'm not prepared to accept that.

LEO
You're going to have to, sir.

BARTLET
The Ambassador's waiting.

He walks off, leaving Leo at the base of the stairs.

CUT TO: INT.  HOSPITAL  GERMANY  NIGHT

We see Josh and Colin seated across from each other in the hallway.

COLIN
Looks like your boy's got himself into a bit of trouble.

JOSH
My boy?

COLIN
Bartlet.

JOSH
He's been President Bartlet for six years; he hasn't been a boy for about 50.

COLIN
Israelis are never gonna meet with Farad. Why should they? They've got him
surrounded in the West Bank. What does Bartlet think they're going to do,
knock on the door of his compound and say, "I'm so sorry about the tanks
and stuff, but would you like to pop over to America and have a nice wee
chat and sort this out?"?

JOSH
Where are you from?

COLIN
Belfast.

JOSH
You guys are really the model on how to work things out over there.

COLIN
Yeah, we are, actually.

JOSH
The Israelis have every right to protect themselves from terrorists.

COLIN
They don't occupy a force to oppress...

JOSH
They're citizen soldiers trying to keep their sisters from getting blown up
on a bus.

COLIN
You Jewish?

JOSH
Why? You anti-Semitic?

COLIN
Anyone who thinks the Palestinians have a point is anti-Semitic.

JOSH
And anyone who thinks the Jews don't after being chased and exiled and
persecuted for centuries is either an idiot or a fool, probably both.

CUT TO: INT.  OVAL OFFICE  DAY

Bartlet and Leo are meeting with the Israeli Ambassador.

BARTLET
Madame Ambassador.

AMBASSADOR GALIT
Mr. McGarry.

LEO
Pleasure.

GALIT
Thank you.

BARTLET
Please.

They sit down to talk.

GALIT
Admiral Fitzwallace was a great man. All Israelis mourn his loss.

BARTLET

GALIT
Israel can not agree to attend a summit with Chairman Farad while our citizens
are being brutally murdered every day.

BARTLET
Whether we like it or not, Farad is in charge.

GALIT
The United States has sought regime change in dictatorships around the
world. Is Israel to be held to a higher standard?

BARTLET
Israel was created to be a land free from oppression. Whether Israel is
Palestinian, Jewish, Jordanian, or Judean, the people who live in the
territories are oppressed: by their own leadership, by the neglect of Arab
neighbors, and, yes, by Israel.

GALIT
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

She gets up and Bartlet and Leo get up as well.

GALIT
Chairman Farad is interested in only one thing: murdering Israelis. And,
apparently, he's decided it's now time to start murdering Americans as well. We
won't participate in any discussions which include Chairman Farad. If you'll
excuse me, sir.

She leaves.

CUT TO: INT.  PRESS BRIEFING ROOM  DAY

C.J. is briefing the press. All the reporters shout for C.J. to call on them.

C.J.
Gordon.

GORDON
Republicans are on their way to the White House this afternoon to meet with
the President. Any idea what they're planning to say?

C.J.
I'm sure the Republican leadership is going to do what they always do:
express their unanimous and unqualified support of the President's policies.

Several people laugh.

GORDON
It's not just the Republicans. The Democrats are saying they don't understand
why the President is wringing his hands while the Israelis send tanks.

C.J.
We're working closely with leaders of both parties on this. They know the
President is determined to act.

GORDON
No, they don't, C.J., neither do the American people. Gallup is saying 82%
support immediate military action in response to Gaza.

C.J.
The President doesn't make security decisions based on opinion polls. Chris?

CHRIS
Have the Israelis agreed to participate in a summit with the
Palestinians? Israeli officials are saying, privately, they won't attend if
Farad is invited.

CUT TO: INT.  LEO'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

Leo is watching C.J.'s briefing.

C.J.
We're discussing the specifics of any possible talks with members of
the Palestinian authority and members of the Israeli government. These
conversations are ongoing.

Toby knocks and comes in.

TOBY
How's she doing?

LEO
Okay, considering she's human chum. Anything from Josh?

TOBY
Yeah. Donna's back in surgery. Something about a pulmonary embolism.

LEO
Margaret!

TOBY

60 Minutes is going to run an interview with Christine Korb.

Margaret walks in.

LEO
Yeah. C.J. told me this morning. [to Margaret] See if you can reach Josh.

She leaves.

TOBY
We need to get to Alicia DeSantos.

 LEO
The President doesn't want us holding out a grief-stricken widow like some
political lawn ornament.

TOBY
I can call. You don't have to let the President know...

LEO
Not today, okay, Toby. I've got enough problems...

TOBY
What's the President doing, Leo? A summit? He's already got a Nobel
Prize. What's he need a second one for, book ends?

Margaret comes back in.

MARGARET
The Speaker's here.

Leo stands up.

LEO
Let the President's office know, then show 'em in.

MARGARET
He brought half of Congress with him. Don't think they'll all fit.

CUT TO: INT.  ROOSEVELT ROOM  DAY

Haffley is seated at the center of the table with several congressmen and
women around him. Some of them stand up as Leo and Toby come into the room.

LEO
Mr. Speaker, nice to see you. Richard, David, Leslie. Sheila, surprised to
see you running with this crowd.

SHEILA
This isn't a partisan issue.

HAFFLEY
We thought a show of unity would be helpful to the White House.

LEO
The President's finishing something up in the Oval. He'll be right with us.

HAFFLEY
Have you been listening to the radio?

LEO
I've been a little busy.

HAFFLEY
Have you been listening to the radio?

TOBY
Oldies radio, traffic report?

HAFFLEY
The nation's taking the announcement of these peace talks badly. Many people
believe you sent Congressmen into harm's way.

Bartlet comes in. The Congressmen stand.

BARTLET
Are these the same right-wing, turkey-basters that said I faked MS to get
the sympathy vote in the last election? Nice to see everyone. Please, sit down.

Sheila moves to sit down but stands back up when she sees that Haffley did
not sit down.

HAFFLEY
Members of Congress were killed, Mr. President. Instead of seeking justice,
you're typing up name tags and inviting them to play dodgeball at Camp David.

SHEILA
You're ignoring the sacrifice these men made for their country.

BARTLET
On the contrary, I'm trying to honor it.

HAFFLEY
You're appeasing terrorists by rewarding them with a peace summit.

LEO
If the issue here is Congressional consultation, we can assure you...

HAFFLEY
Mr. President, you have to go on national television, admit your mistake, and
retract those invitations. You've insulted these men and their memories. You
have to put this summit back into the cereal box it came in.

BARTLET
I didn't come here to play games.

He walks around to the door.

BARTLET
I'm trying to find a way to make peace. And when I do, you can go on TV and
explain why you're against it.

He leaves.

CUT TO: INT.  OUTER OVAL OFFICE  DAY

We see Bartlet walk in from the hallway and he goes into the Oval Office. We
see a TV broadcasting a story about the possible peace summit.

CUT TO: INT.  HALLWAY - HOSPITAL  GERMANY  NIGHT

We see Donna's doctor coming down the hallway to talk to Josh and Colin.

DOCTOR
Ms. Moss was experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. Her chest CT
revealed a blood clot in her right lung. She asked if she could see you for
a moment before we put her under.

COLIN
Me?

DOCTOR
Uh, no. Mr. Lyman.

He indicates for Josh to come with him.

CUT TO: INT.  OPERATING ROOM  NIGHT

Josh and the Doctor walk into the operating room where Donna is lying on
a gurney. Several doctors are around her prepping for surgery. Josh walks
over to her side.

JOSH
I just talked to the doctor; they said it's no big deal.

Donna writes something on a pad of paper and shows it to Josh. It says
"NICE HAT".

JOSH
Yeah. Stylish, huh. They tell you what they're going to do?

She nods her head.

JOSH
It's gonna be a snap.

She again writes on the pad and shows it to Josh. This time it says "SCARED".

JOSH
Yeah. Don't be. You're going to be fine, okay?

DOCTOR
Okay, Donna, here we go.

One of the doctors picks up her IV and injects something into it.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT.  LEO'S OFFICE  DAY

Leo is talking with General Alexander.

ALEXANDER
The strike force can launch in six hours. It's two hours to the targets in
Syria, same to Gaza. Air-to-ground smart munitions against both, back on
the deck in four hours.

LEO
Intel still has Khalil Nasan at the same location in Gaza?

ALEXANDER
So far. We just have to hope he stays there until midmorning. [pause] You'll
talk to him?

LEO
Yeah.

ALEXANDER
We lose track of Nasan now, who knows where we pick him up again.

LEO
Thank you, General.

Alexander gets up and leaves. Leo leans back against the couch. Kate walks in.

KATE
Leo, do you have a minute?

LEO
Yeah, sure.

He indicates for her to sit.

KATE
I encouraged the President to pursue a meeting with Mukarat. I should have
anticipated Chairman Farad...

LEO
Did you bury a mortar shell on the roadside in Gaza two days ago?

KATE
No, sir. I just feel that in hindsight...

LEO
The President heard what he wanted to hear and went where he wanted to
go. He's over 21. Don't flatter yourself, Commander, you're not changing
the course of history.

KATE
I won't take up any more of your time.

She gets up to leave.

LEO
He doesn't like chaos. We bomb some apartment building in Gaza or a camp in
Syria there'll be consequences. And we can't tell him what they're going to
be. Will we get drawn into a war in the Middle East? Will suicide bombers
be climbing onto buses in Pasaic, New Jersey, instead of Haifa and Tel Aviv?

Margaret knocks and comes in.

MARGARET
Excuse me, Leo. The President's asking for you and Ms. Harper in the Oval.

Leo gets up from the couch. We see Leo open the door from his office and
Kate and he go into the corridor between his and Bartlet's office.

LEO
The President's looking for answers and we don't have them.

CUT TO: INT.  OVAL OFFICE  DAY

Bartlet is meeting with Leo, Kate, C.J., Toby, and Will.

BARTLET
No idea is too stupid or outrageous: party clowns; piatas; I'd build a mosque
out of jello if I thought... I need ideas, new ideas, come on. Just throw
things out and we'll see if anything comes of it.

There is a long pause and we can hear the clock tick in the silence. Finally,
Toby speaks.

TOBY
Sir, I think we need to shift the conversation back to the military...

BARTLET
Come on, who else?

We again hear the clock tick. This time, C.J. breaks the silence.

C.J.
Is the FBI any closer to...?

BARTLET
I'm serious, Farad and the Israelis: how to get them into a room together.

C.J.
Well, sir, previous peace plans have focused on getting Chairman Farad to
crack down on Hamas and other terrorist groups...

TOBY
Farad's not powerful enough.

BARTLET
No idea is too stupid or outrageous...

WILL
We let Chairman Farad come to Camp David...


TOBY

No, no, no, no, no.


C.J.
There's no one else in the region with an interest in ending the violence...

WILL
...sticking their necks out...

C.J.
If there was some way to add credibility to the summit, something both the
Israelis and the Palestinians would...

KATE
Really stupid ideas?

BARTLET
Yes, absolutely.

KATE
We ignore everything that's happened in the last 24 hours. Yesterday, Farad
was cooperating with us, planning to arrest Nasan and the other perpetrators
of the CODEL bombing. Then the Israelis surrounded his compound in the West
Bank and his people in Gaza refused to arrest Nasan, right?

WILL
Yeah, so?

KATE
So we hold Farad to his earlier promise. Tell him if he wants a summit
that he has to arrest Nasan. Show us and the Israelis he's serious about
punishing terrorists.

TOBY
How's he supposed to do that, when his compound is surrounded by Israeli tanks?

KATE
Farad was never going to do it himself. The Palestinian Authority was just
waiting for his okay to proceed.

C.J.
The Israelis turned off his power. His cell phone's dead.

KATE
Get him a new one. The Israelis aren't going to stop the American consulate
from giving him a new battery.

WILL
They might.

TOBY
A cell phone?

KATE
He can use mine, if he wants.

TOBY
You're right, it's a stupid idea.

KATE
Why?

TOBY
Who cares if he has a phone? He's not going to punish Nasan. He's rounded
up terrorists before. He walks them past Al Jazerra for show and then puts
them under house arrest in a palace with a squash court and high-speed
internet access.

C.J.
Tell him he has to turn Nasan over to us.

WILL
He won't do it.

C.J.
How do you know?

TOBY
He won't. Half his followers think Nasan's a hero for blowing up
Americans. He's going to turn the guy over to the Great Satan?

C.J.
If he says no or equivocates, we go public. Say we wanted Nasan for a summit,
but when we identified the killer we asked Farad to turn him over, he
refused. We look reasonable, measured. Farad has no one to blame but himself.

KATE
And if he does turn over Nasan we go to the Israelis and say, hey, look,
he's serious this time.

They all look at Bartlet as we hear the clock tick.

BARTLET
Can it work?

TOBY
No.

WILL
No.

KATE
Maybe.

C.J.
Maybe.

LEO
Okay. Somebody get the man a cell phone and tell him to expect a call from
the President. Thanks everyone.

They all get up and leave.

KATE
Leo. You're okay...?

LEO
Coordinate with State.

KATE
Thank you.

She leaves and closes the door behind her.

LEO
Congress is drafting a resolution demanding that you take military action.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Sir, the Lincoln battle group will be in position sometime tonight. They're
awaiting your go order to strike Nasan and the Syrian camps in the morning.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
We can't wait for Farad. The risk of losing Khalil Nasan is too great. We
have intel linking Iran to the Martyrs. It's sketchy in spots, but overall
it's a compelling case. I'm recommending you include Iran in the attacks.

BARTLET
General Alexander went ahead with plans for these bombings?

LEO
At your request.

BARTLET
I said I'd consider it when the time was appropriate. I did not ask...

LEO
He was trying to anticipate your eventual need, sir, at my
urging. Mr. President, please. Congress, the Joint Chiefs, the American public,
your own staff, everyone disagrees with your assessment of the situation.

BARTLET
Killing Palestinians isn't going to make us feel safer. They'll kill more
of us, we'll kill more of them. It's Russian roulette with a fully-loaded gun.

LEO
We can't allow terrorists to murder our citizens without...

BARTLET
Why would they do it? Why would Palestinians murders American government
officials? They never have before. They're deliberately provoking us, Leo. They
know that we have to retaliate. They've studied us. They want us to overreact.

LEO
This isn't overreacting. It's the appropriate, balanced...

BARTLET
Tell me how this ends, Leo! You want me to start something that may have
serious repercussions on American foreign policy for decades, but you don't
know how it ends.

LEO
[shouting] We don't always know how it ends! [calmer] The Lincoln will be
in position in a few hours and then you are going to have to give the go
ahead for the bombings.

BARTLET
Or what? [pause] Let me know when Chairman Farad calls. I'll be in the
Residence.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

He leaves.

CUT TO: INT.  RESIDENCE  SITTING ROOM  NIGHT

Bartlet is sitting on the couch looking out the window when Abbey comes in.

ABBEY
It's late.

BARTLET
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

ABBEY
Hmm. No. Still nothing?

He shakes his head.

BARTLET
Maybe I'm wrong.

ABBEY
Maybe.

BARTLET
You think so?

She shakes her head.

BARTLET
Am I that predictable now?

ABBEY
You were always that predictable.

BARTLET
I could do what they want; make everyone feel better for a few days. Some
nice aerial shots of things blowing up on CNN, a few charred bodies, it'd
be a hell of a lot easier.

ABBEY
You want easier?

BARTLET
I want Fitz to walk through my door tomorrow and give me a hard time about
the Celtics.

ABBEY
You think they have a chance this year?

BARTLET
Who?

ABBEY
The Celtics.

BARTLET
They still need a big man and a reliable point-guard, but they might make
a run for it.

ABBEY
For a moment there I was worried.

CUT TO: INT.  TOBY'S OFFICE  NIGHT

Toby is sitting on his couch and we see C.J. walking through the Communications
bullpen and into his office.

C.J.
Hey.

She throws him a package of peanut butter crackers and sits down across
from him.

C.J.
I nabbed the last two packages of crackers out of the machine. It was that,
or an old egg salad sandwich.

TOBY
I thought you went home.

C.J.
And pass up the Sixteenth Street smorgasbord? I wouldn't have been able to
sleep anyway. Catching up on some work.

Toby coughs and C.J. tosses him a bottle of water.

C.J.
Here. You'll need some water. Maybe a fire hose.

TOBY
Or a local reservoir.

C.J.
How the hell do we always get dragged into these things? Why can't I just
sit on my patio, barbeque some chicken, and drink my Diet Dr. Pepper in
peace. You going to finish those?

TOBY
Be my guest.

He tosses her his package of crackers.

C.J.
Do you ever look around and say if we're the ones in charge, this country's
in a hell of a lot of trouble?

TOBY
Until I spend time with the other guys.

Will comes into the office.

WILL
They got a phone to Farad. The President's talking to him now.

CUT TO: INT.  OVAL OFFICE  NIGHT

Bartlet is on the phone with Chairman Farad. Also in the room are Leo, Kate,
and another man listening in on the other phone.

BARTLET
I'm afraid that's unacceptable, Mr. Chairman. If your security forces were
to capture Nasan, we want him turned over to us.

Toby, Will, and C.J. come in.

FARAD [VO]
The crime was committed in the Palestinian territories.

LEO
The territories aren't a state.

BARTLET
Trying Nasan in an American court shows there are other means of seeking
justice than Israeli missile strikes.

FARAD [VO]
This point can also be made in Palestinian courts.

Kate grabs a pad of paper from C.J. and a pen from Will and begins writing.

TOBY
What Palestinian court? It three guys with loaded pistols and a magic
eight ball.

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, capturing Nasan and then turning him over to us would demonstrate
to the Israelis and the world that you're tough on terror. That you know
the difference between fighting for the Palestinian cause and randomly
attacking Americans.

Kate tears off a piece of the paper and lays it down on Bartlet's desk.

FARAD [VO]
All it would demonstrate is that Palestinians are incapable of administering
justice themselves.

Bartlet shakes his head and Kate hands the pad back to C.J.

BARTLET
Americans were killed, Mr. Chairman. This falls under our jurisdiction. Even
if you were to detain Nasan, we would ask that you extradite him. [pause]
Mr. Chairman?

FARAD [VO]
These are difficult questions. Perhaps they should be a topic of our talks
at Camp David.

Kate takes back the paper from C.J. and begins writing. She finds that the
pen has stopped working.

BARTLET
There won't be any talks if Khalil Nasan isn't delivered into United States
custody.

FARAD [VO]
Mr. President, that makes things very difficult. Perhaps then, Mr. President,
we will not be able to meet.

Kate grabs a pen from the President's desk and spills his coffee in the
process. She tears off a piece of the paper and hands it to Bartlet. He
reads it and gives it to Leo.

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, if your security forces were to detain Nasan and then turn
him over to us secretly, we'd be happy to say that he was apprehended by
the FBI. [pause] Mr. Chairman?

FARAD [VO]
I will discuss it with members of my government.

BARTLET
And you'll seriously consider it?

FARAD [VO]
I will discuss it.

BARTLET
Thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman.

FARAD [VO]
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet hangs up the phone.

C.J.
Was that a yes or a no?

WILL
Members of my government? I think he was talking about two sock puppets and
a beanie baby.

TOBY
He won't do it. He can't do it.

KATE
Sounded like he was considering it.

WILL
He was distracted, looking up Nasan's number so he can warn him to get the
hell out of Gaza.

KATE
There's no evidence linking Nasan to Farad or his government.

WILL
That's only because we haven't interrogated him yet.

KATE
So now all Palestinians are terrorists?

WILL
If the kaffiat fits...

LEO
That's enough. Thank you, everybody. Go home, try to get some sleep.

They all leave except for Leo.

LEO
Now what?

BARTLET
We wait.

LEO
The Lincoln battle group is almost...

BARTLET
We wait, Leo.

Leo leaves.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT.  HOSPITAL  GERMANY  NIGHT

Colin is lying on one couch and Josh is sitting on another.

COLIN
So you fly halfway around the world at a moment's notice to rush to a woman's
beside when the White House is facing off a biblical apocalypse?

JOSH
We work together.

COLIN
Past alliances gone bad or tragically unconsummated love kept at arm's length
by puritanical American workplace ethics.

JOSH
What are you talking about?

COLIN
There was this girl when I was 16. No, 17.

JOSH
So, you're a bagman for the IRA?

COLIN
She was mad about me, worshipped me, really, and I liked her, but I was off
to the University in Dublin and she was going to stay in Belfast, work in
a night shop.

JOSH
This is taking too long. Isn't this taking too long?

COLIN
She wrote to me every single day, and she called weekends and she was always
there. And I took her for granted, you know?

JOSH

The doctor walks up.

DOCTOR
Mr. Lyman.

JOSH
How's she doing?

DOCTOR
We encountered a few difficulties during the procedure. She lost a substantial
amount of blood. We had to transfuse and call in a vascular surgeon to repair
the tear.

COLIN
Is she going to be all right?

DOCTOR
She's still unconscious. As soon as she's stable we'll send her off for an
MRI. Between the anemia and the low blood pressure she may have suffered
hypoxic brain injury. Decreased oxygen delivery can result in brain damage.


CUT TO: INT.  OVAL OFFICE  DAY

Bartlet, Charlie and Leo are talking.

LEO
They had to do some sort of operation and there were complications. I spoke
to Josh. He was pretty upset.

BARTLET
Can you get me Donna's parents?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Charlie leaves to the outer office.

Leo comes and sits across from Bartlet.

LEO
We've heard nothing from Chairman Farad for over seven hours. General
Alexander is waiting in the Sit Room. The Lincoln Carrier group is in place.

George knocks and comes in.

GEORGE
Excuse me, Mr. President.

LEO
What do you need, George?

GEORGE
Our FBI team in Gaza was just contacted by the Palestinian security
forces. They have Khalil Nasan in custody and they'd like to turn him over
to us.

CUT TO: INT.  RESIDENCE  DAY

We see Toby step out of the elevator and he begins sprinting to the sitting
room where Leo and Charlie are waiting outside the bedroom door.

LEO
Did it pass?


TOBY
House was 317 to 116; Senate was 62 to 37. [reading] 'Whereas acts of
treacherous and unprovoked violence have been committed against United
States citizens.'

LEO
Just skip ahead to the parts that are gonna piss me off.

TOBY
That's gonna be all of it, really. [reading] 'Whereas an action further
threatens the national security of these United States, and there can be
no meaningful peace in the Middle East so long as such acts are sanctioned
and committed.'

LEO
Here it comes.

TOBY
[reading] 'And whereas the President has both the authority and the imperative
to address and prevent such acts of terror against the United States.'

LEO
'The President has both the authority and the imperative'?

CHARLIE
That doesn't sound so bad.

TOBY
It's the Oxford Debating Society's way of telling the President to get off
his ass and do something, you feckless wimp.

Bartlet comes out of the bedroom.

BARTLET
Is she here?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. And the Prime Minister is waiting for your call in Tel Aviv.

BARTLET
It passed?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How many Democrats against us?

TOBY
Too many.

BARTLET
But we swept the Vermont delegation, am I right?

He grabs the papers from Toby's hand.

TOBY
Actually, no.

CUT TO: EXT.  PORTICO  DAY

Bartlet, Toby, Leo, Charlie, and a Secret Service man are walking to the
Oval Office.

BARTLET
'Both the authority and the imperative'?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
They want peace, but I have to blow something up first?

LEO
I think they're willing to haggle on the peace part.

BARTLET
That usually work in the past?

They walk into the Outer Oval Office. Kate is waiting at the door.

BARTLET
How's my tie?

KATE
I would have gone with the blue, sir.

BARTLET
Charlie, get the Prime Minister on the phone. Ms. Harper, head on in and
look unhappy.

Kate goes into the Oval Office.

BARTLET
Toby, I want you to call every Democrat that supported this resolution and tell
them that if they ever want White House support for another rubber-chicken
fundraiser, they had better start singing a rousing chorus of 'Hail to
the Chief'.

He hands Toby the papers. Toby leaves. Bartlet heads toward the door of the
Oval Office. Leo follows him. Bartlet turns before they enter the Oval to
speak to Leo.

BARTLET
Leo, head down to the Sit Room and tell the generals to keep their pistols
in there pockets for the time being. You don't believe in this, Leo, and
they're not going to want to do it. I can't have them picking up any signals
from you that we disagree.

LEO
No, sir.

Bartlet goes into the Oval and shuts the door behind him.

CUT TO: INT.  HOSPITAL  GERMANY  NIGHT

We see that Donna is asleep in her bed. Colin is sitting beside it. We hear
Josh on the phone with Toby and we pan to see that Josh is in the hall.

JOSH
So, uh, Fields voted for it?

TOBY [VO]

JOSH
Wow! Goffman?

Toby is standing at his desk and he is on the phone with Josh. C.J. comes

CUT TO: INT.  HOSPITAL  GERMANY  CONTINUOUS

NURSE

She points to a sign behind Josh which indicates no cell phones.

JOSH
Oh, God, really? I don't have a pacemaker or anything.

NURSE
Turn it off know, sir.

JOSH
OK, sure, Lieutenant.

TOBY [VO]
Who you talking to?

JOSH
Nurse Ratchett. I got to hang up. I'll call back in a couple hours.

He hangs up.

CUT TO: INT.  OVAL OFFICE  DAY

Bartlet, Kate, and the Israeli Ambassador is on the phone with ISRAELI PRIME
MINISTER ELI ZAHAVY.

BARTLET
The Palestinian Authority has detained Khalil Nasan and is prepared to turn
him over to our FBI.


ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ELI ZAHAVY [VO]
Farad's promised to turn over terrorists before.

BARTLET
It's a show of good faith on Chairman Farad's part; an example of his renewed
willingness to address the peace process. Mr. Prime Minister, the territories
are undermining your legitimacy as a modern Democracy and sapping your moral
authority in the eyes of the world.

ZAHAVE [VO]
Farad is beholden to the very forces that wish to push us back into the
sea. It's not a negotiating point for him. It's a religious and a moral
imperative to take back all of Israel for Palestine.

BARTLET
Sir, you cannot hold yourself out as the Promised Land while occupying the
territories and oppressing other peoples.

ZAHAVY [VO]
Our Arab citizens enjoy the most freedoms of any Arabs in the Middle
East. Palestinians are oppressed as opposed to... We don't stone women who
refuse to wear head scarves in Tel Aviv.

KATE
Sir, Chairman Farad says you're almost done building the fence in the West
Bank. He's about to lose half the Jordan Valley to unilateral settlements.

BARTLET
If you agree to come to a summit with Farad and he still refuses to reach an
agreement, the United States is willing to publicly support Israeli actions
to secure your homeland, including the building of the fence. [pause] Eli,
why not sit down and talk again?

ZAHAVY [VO]
If Farad turns over this terrorist to you, I will take this offer to my
Cabinet.

BARTLET
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

ZAHAVY [VO]
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

Bartlet hangs up.

BARTLET
Madame Ambassador.

GALIT
Mr. President.

The Ambassador leaves.

BARTLET
I think we've got ourselves a ballgame.

CUT TO: EXT.  HELICOPTER LANDING AREA  DAY

We see that Marine One is ready to go. We see Bartlet, Abbey, Leo, Toby,
Kate, and Will heading toward the helicopter.

TOBY
Have you ever been to NSF Thurmont before?

KATE
Camp David? No, I haven't.

TOBY
Ever been on Marine One?

KATE
No, I haven't.

TOBY
You like helicopters?

KATE
No, not really. I get airsick.

TOBY
Okay, you can sit with Will.

Bartlet and Leo have stopped just in front of the steps to the chopper.

BARTLET
I want you to stay here, hold down the fort. I'll call you when things heat up.

LEO
Of course, Mr. President.

BARTLET
You still think this is a mistake?

LEO
Yes, sir, I do.

BARTLET
As soon as the Palestinian delegation is on the ground at Andrews, give
Alexander the go.

LEO
Sir?

BARTLET
Tell the general to hit the Ein Hawa camps near Damascus.

LEO
What about Iran?

BARTLET
I looked at the Intel file. I'm still not convinced. You get something more,
show it to me and we'll discuss it.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet gets on the plane, saluting the Marine at the base of the stairs as
he gets on. We see Marine One fly off over the trees.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.

C.J. [VO]
You guys do s'mores and strategic planning last night?

WILL
And missiles and marshmallows.

CUT TO: INT.  LOBBY  WHITE HOUSE  CONTINUOUS

We see C.J. and Carol walking while C.J. is on the phone with Will.

C.J.

stories are about the Crusades.

Yeah, well...

CUT TO: EXT.  ROAD  CAMP DAVID  CONTINUOUS

CUT TO: INT.  CAROL'S OFFICE  DAY

We see C.J. and Carol walking into C.J.'s office.

C.J. [cont.]

sealant.

C.J.
Try and get him up at Camp David.

CAROL
He's not at Camp David. He's in his office.

CUT TO: INT.  LEO'S OFFICE  DAY

Leo is seated at a table in his office when C.J. comes around the corner,
knocks on the door, and goes into his office.

C.J.
I thought you went up yesterday with the President.

LEO
Couple of loose ends. We want the Press Corps down here.

C.J.
We're not going to the Cozy Inn?

LEO
The President doesn't want either side negotiating in print. You walk them
through a daily schedule and that's it.

C.J.
No pool spray?

LEO
They go to Camp David, all they're going to get is shots of tinted windows
and enough furrowed brows to start a Yiddish theater group.

Margaret comes in and hands a piece of paper to Leo.

MARGARET
They're ready for you.

LEO
We might have an announcement in a couple of hours.

He begins to leave.

C.J.
What announcement?

LEO
I'll find you when it's time.

CUT TO: EXT.  CAMP DAVID  DAY

We see Will jogging along the road to Camp David. Kate speaks to him as he
runs past her.

KATE
How far?

WILL
I only have legs for five miles.

KATE
Buy a carton of Luckys, you can stay in bed next time.

CUT TO: EXT.  TOBY'S CABIN  DAY

Kate walks up to the door and knocks. Toby answers the door with his shirt
unbuttoned to where we can see his undershirt. His hair looks semi-ruffled
so as to indicate that he just got out of bed.

KATE
So much for permanent press. The prep groups about to start up on the
lower porch.

He begins to open the door as though he was going to go out but then stops,
goes back in, grabs his coat, tie, and shoes, and leaves the cabin.

CUT TO: EXT.  POOL  DAY

We see Bartlet swimming the length of the pool. As he reaches the other side,
Charlie walks up and speaks to him.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, they're on their way.

CUT TO: INT.  MEETING ROOM  DAY

We see, on the table, places are set for the VIPs attending the summit. Each
place has a large notepad, a small notepad, a pen, a pencil, an empty glass
sitting on a lace doily, and a card indicating who the place is for. We
see that Debbie is checking the places to make sure that the placement of
the certain items are place perfectly. She has a ruler in her hand to check
each place. We open on the place for Prime Minister Eli Zahavy. She moves on
to the place for Mahmoud El-Welwail. Next, she moves to the place for Yasser
Al-Dura. The ruler indicates that the notepad is positioned slightly off. She
looks up and looks sternly at one of the aides who are with her. A woman comes
around her and repositions the notepad so that it is positioned correctly.

CUT TO: INT  PRESIDENT'S CABIN  DAY

Abbey comes into the room to speak to Bartlet. We see that he is getting
dressed to greet the delegations. He is trying to tie his tie.

ABBEY
Did you come to a consensus?

BARTLET
Only that Toby would give half his salary for piece of asphalt he could use
to pummel the State Department.

She comes to him and begins adjusting his tie.

ABBEY
You're making a mess of it. Give me that. What's the sticking point?

BARTLET
What isn't? If we can't agree, how do we expect them to?

Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
The Israelis just cleared our airspace.

ABBEY
Okay.

She pats Bartlet on the shoulder and he buttons his vest.

CUT TO: EXT.  HELICOPTER LANDING AREA  CAMP DAVID  DAY

We see a Marine helicopter passing over the helipad and we see it land. When
it does, a dress-Marine comes to the door and opens it. We see Bartlet and
Abbey walk up to the carpet that has been laid for the Israeli delegation.

ABBEY
Go get 'em, Cassius.

BARTLET
Thank you.

He walks up to the helicopter as we see Prime Minister Zahavy get off, along
with his wife, MAYA. We see the Ambassador get off behind them. Bartlet
greets them by shaking Zahavy's hand and kissing Maya on the cheek.

BARTLET
Mr. Prime Minister, welcome and thank you for coming.

Abraham Lincoln.

MUKARAT
My pleasure.

BARTLET

FARAD
Mr. President.

ABBEY
Chairman.

BARTLET
Please join us here.

He indicates toward the building.

CUT TO: INT.  SITUATION ROOM  DAY

We see Leo standing and looking at one of the maps displayed on the
boards. Alexander walks up to him.

ALEXANDER
They're 30 minutes out, sir. Do we have the go? That's a go. You going up
to Camp David later?

LEO
Maybe tomorrow.

ALEXANDER
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I hope the President knows how lucky
he is to have you.

He walks off.

CUT TO: INT.  MEETING ROOM  CAMP DAVID  DAY

We see Bartlet standing at the end of the table and he speaks to those present.

BARTLET
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

He sits as we hear much applause from around the table.

We see on a TV set, a reporter reporting the capture of Khalil Nasan. We pan
around to see Josh sitting by Donna's bed, watching the report. We focus on
Donna, and we see her slowly open her eyes as Josh still watches the TV.

DONNA
Josh?

He blinks and looks over, startled by hearing her speak.

DONNA
Josh? Josh.

He stands and leans over, looking at her in unbelief.

JOSH
Hey, you're awake. Your mom is here. Colin took her downstairs for some... I
don't know, some schnitzel, or something.

DONNA
You're still here.

JOSH
Yeah. I'm still here.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
