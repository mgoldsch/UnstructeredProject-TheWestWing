FADE IN: INT. MEETING ROOM - CAMP DAVID - DAY
      DAY TWO

We open in the meeting room. The many people here for the meeting are clapping
and applauding for Bartlet.

BARTLET
We will require a resolution that balances the needs of both with respect to
the national identities and the religious beliefs of both, but I'm telling
you there can be no lasting peace, no regional stability, without a strong
and secure Israel, and there can be no lasting peace without a sovereign,
viable state for the Palestinians.

CUT TO: INT. - PRESS ROOM - DAY

We see, on a TV set, that C.J. is briefing the press.

C.J.
Good morning. Let me give you a rundown on what's happened so far at Camp
David.

We pan around into the Briefing Room where C.J. is standing at the podium.

C.J. [cont.]
The Israeli and Palestinian delegations arrived yesterday evening. The
parties reconvened at 10:20 this morning and the President will be meeting
privately with the Chairman and Prime Minister Zahavy at 12:00. Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs General Alexander will make a brief statement after which
he will take questions. General.

C.J. steps back and General Alexander steps forward.

ALEXANDER
Moments ago, FA-18 Hornets off the Abraham Lincoln in the Persian Gulf struck
the Ein Hawa terrorist training camp, 32 kilometers southwest of Damascus
in the Kingdom of Syria.

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING ROOM - CAMP DAVID - DAY

Bartlet is still talking with the delegations.

BARTLET
Whether you choose to do this today or ten years from today, you will face
the same geography, the same neighbors, the same ancient animosities. More
years of bloodshed and pain will not change those facts. The only path to
a real and lasting peace is through negotiation.

Debbie steps up to Bartlet and hands him a piece of paper with a note on
it. He reads it while Toby stands and addresses the delegation.

TOBY
The parties have agreed to break into subgroups this afternoon after Chairman
Farad, Prime Minister Zahavy, and President Bartlet meet to agree on topics
of discussion.

BARTLET
Excuse me, Toby, if I may.

He stands to speak. Toby sits.

BARTLET [cont.]
You'll be hearing this news shortly, but our FBI has identified the group
responsible for the deaths of Americans in Gaza and we've launched an attack
on their camp in Syria. Gentlemen, if you will, meet me on the Aspen Terrace
at noon. Thank you.

He leaves as the rest of the men and women around the table stand.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We open on a shot of three flagpoles bearing the flags of the United States,
Israel, and Palestine. We pan around to see different buildings and people
moving around.

CUT TO: INT. - PORCH - DAY

Toby, Will, and Kate are talking about the negotiations.


TOBY

No, no, no, no, no...


WILL
They're not getting Jerusalem.

KATE
We say that in our opening, Farad's not going to be here long enough to
unpack his toothbrush.

TOBY
Go back to your opening list, again.

WILL
Farad gets security guarantees and takes tangible action against Hamas,
and he ain't getting Jerusalem.

TOBY
Enough with Jerusalem! Kate.

KATE
Israel allows the Palestinians to form a viable, sovereign state in the
Territories. We need to discuss the right of return...

WILL
We aren't going to get a deal on refugees.

KATE
They have to go somewhere.

WILL
Well, I hear there's room in Montana. They can rent a cabin and try to secede
from the Union.

TOBY
Can we go inside. I got like flies or little gnats or something.

KATE
And we need something on Jerusalem.

Bartlet walks in.

BARTLET
So, do we finally have a draft?

WILL
No.

TOBY
Yes.

Toby takes a sheet of paper from Kate and brings it to Bartlet.

WILL
The Israelis aren't going to give up Jerusalem.

KATE
Palestinians aren't going to make a deal without it.

Bartlet takes out his glasses and reads the paper.

BARTLET
We're back where we were last night?

Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
Delegation's are on their way.

BARTLET
We punt on Jerusalem this morning, tackle it later, agreed?

As Bartlet begins to leave, Kate and Will stand.

WILL
Mister "Share-your-gum-with-everyone" over here.

TOBY
Yeah.

WILL
Why isn't Leo up here?

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is sitting at the table listening to Haffley who is on TV.

HAFFLEY [on TV]
This President has a solemn duty to help the only true democracy in the
Middle East to defend itself against murderers. Murderers of Israelis,
murderers of thousands of...

C.J. comes in.

C.J.
Josh lands in an hour.

She sees Haffley on the TV.

C.J.
CNN's got the Speaker on an endless loop like a... Pink Floyd concert. It's
their way of punishing us for cutting off access to Camp David.

LEO
Natives restless?

C.J.
There might be a mutiny afoot. I heard a couple of them plotting to throw
our Mr. Coffee's into the Potomac.

LEO
Speaker's on his way over. I doubt he'll miss the cameras on his way in or
his way out.

C.J.
You were looking for me?

LEO
We're losing the media war. I want us on the morning shows, Crossfire,
Dateline, book This Old House if we can figure out an angle.

C.J.
Who goes?

LEO
You, me, the Assistant Deputy Secretary for Fishery Exploitation; I don't
care. We've got to get our message out.

C.J.
And what is our message?

LEO
"Shut up while we're trying to get them to stop killing each other."

CUT TO: EXT. - ASPEN TERRACE - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see Bartlet, Farad, Zahavy, and Debbie walking to the couches set on
the Terrace.

FARAD
Mr. President, how are your children? Your grandchildren? Everything is well,
I hope.

BARTLET
They're all very well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Please. Annie started high
school last week. I've ordered some tea. Would anyone like anything else?

ZAHAVY
Uh, tea is fine, thank you.

FARAD
The same.

BARTLET
We need to agree on the topics of discussion for the subgroups. I've taken
the liberty of coming up with a few things to help us get started. First,
security for Israel after withdrawal from the Territories.

ZAHAVY
We will need to maintain military presence in the Jordan...

FARAD
What sort of a message this sends to my people about sovereignty.

BARTLET
Please, excuse me. Discussion of these issues is for the subgroups. We're
only suggesting topics now.

An aide brings a tray with the tea on it and sets it on one of the tables.

BARTLET
Thank you. Second, Disposition of the settlements and the land apportioned
to them. Third, right of return for refugees.

ZAHAVY
Though it is not "right" of return, it's a "claim" of return.

BARTLET
Fourth, how the Palestinian Authority will go about dismantling terrorist
groups. Well, that's four topics. I guess we can catch a double-feature now.

FARAD
What about Jerusalem?

BARTLET
I thought we would put off discussion of Jerusalem until after...

ZAHAVY
We will not give up control of Jerusalem.

FARAD
Jerusalem is central to our topics here.

BARTLET
Gentlemen, please, let's begin on these four issues and see if we can reach
an agreement...

FARAD
We should start with Jerusalem. If we can't resolve that, why are we spending
time on the little things?

ZAHAVY
Little things? Like denouncing terrorism?

FARAD
Our capital must be Jerusalem.

ZAHAVY
Israel will not give up Jerusalem.

FARAD
Then why are we here? Why are any of us here?

Zahavy stands.

ZAHAVY
For once, Mr. Farad, you are right. My apologies, Mr. President, there is
no progress to be made here. I should never have accepted your invitation.

BARTLET
Sit back down, Eli.

ZAHAVY
No, no. We will not negotiate sovereignty over the Temple Mount.

Farad stands as well and we can tell that their discussion is becoming a
little more heated.

FARAD
The Dome of the Rock stands on the site where the prophet Muhammad...

Bartlet stands with a bit of frustration.

BARTLET
Stop it, both of you. Gentlemen, I have staked my personal credibility and
the credibility of the United States on suggesting, perhaps foolishly, that
the Israelis and the Palestinians are reasonable people who would like to
at least try to resolve their differences peacefully: no one is going home
after one hour of talks. Now then, the subgroups will begin on these four
topics after lunch. Thank you.

Zahavy leaves.

FARAD
Excuse me.

Farad leaves in the opposite direction.

BARTLET
That went well, don't you think?

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

C.J. is walking down the hall. Carol is walking beside her and Josh is
walking behind her.

CAROL
C.J.? I've got you booked on Meet the Press, Crossfire, and Taylor Reid.

C.J.
Taylor Reid?

CAROL
Nobody else would do it.

JOSH
Now that's good staff work. Hey.

C.J.
Hey.

They hug.

C.J.
How's Donna?

They begin talking as they walk to Josh's office.

JOSH
She threw me out. Her mother's driving her crazy and her IRA boyfriend is
plotting sedition... or maybe it was seduction, probably both.

C.J.
The dashing photojournalist?

JOSH
Yeah. I think the professional term is "wanker."

C.J.
Listen to you: too much BBC.

JOSH
Too much sauerbraten... Leo's still down here?

C.J.
Yeah, he's in his office.

JOSH
Why isn't he up at Camp David?

C.J. shakes her head.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is sitting at his desk. Josh comes to the door and knocks before coming in.

JOSH
So, where do you want me?

LEO
How's Donna?

JOSH
Better. May be able to fly in a few days.

LEO
Get up to Camp David. Toby's climbing the walls, thinks the President's
going to give away the store.

JOSH
When are you coming up?

LEO
Tomorrow. Maybe the day after.

JOSH
Everything okay?

LEO
The Syrians are blowing enough gaskets to open a new subcontract. They want
a resolution at the U.N.

Josh interrupts, walking out as he does.

JOSH
I'll stop by my apartment, I'll pick up some clothes, I'll drive straight up.

LEO
Margaret!

Margaret comes in.

LEO
Have we heard anything from the President this morning?

MARGARET
No, sir. You want me to call Debbie?

LEO
No, thanks.

She leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

C.J. is briefing the press.

C.J.
Good afternoon. The President, the Prime Minister met successfully this morning
over coffee at Aspen to finalize the topics for today's discussions. Following
lunch, the delegations are breaking into subgroups for this afternoon's
talks on a variety of mutually-agreed-upon subjects. While it's too early to
comment on the direction and tenor of the talks, I can tell you the luncheon
buffet of Maryland crabcakes, baked New England cod, and Washington...

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING AREA - DAY

[Transcriber's Note: Several of the following areas are not clearly
defined. Therefore, they have all been simply named Meeting Area. It will
be made clear who is meeting in each one. They are all at Camp David.]

Josh, Toby, and Will are speaking with Mukarat, Zahavy, and Defense Minister
Massar.

MASSAR
We must have a military presence in the Jordan Valley to secure the borders.

MUKARAT
And how will that be different from the current occupation? How are we a
sovereign nation with IDF units in our streets.

MASSAR
We're gonna have 4 million Palestinians living next door. Israel could be
cut in two by tanks and artillery in about 15 minutes.

TOBY
What tanks? What artillery? Even if every Palestinian man, woman, and child
were given an Uzi, they'd be no match for your military.

MASSAR
And we have no intention of allowing that to change.

MUKARAT
We must be allowed to defend ourselves.

ZAHAVY
Defend yourselves? From who?

MUKARAT
How about Hamas? How are we expected to argue there is no longer a reason
to fight when your army is still there, exactly as before?

MASSAR
We cannot support a withdrawal from the territories without assurances of
our security, and that, gentlemen, means our troops.

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING AREA - DAY

Farad, Galit, Kate, and several other people are sitting at a table and
are talking.

FARAD
A million Palestinians were being forced from their homes, their...

GALIT
Closer to 700,000, and they weren't expelled. They left after being urged
to do so by our...

FARAD
We were being terrorized by Zionist troops who were threatening to torch
every Arab village in the...

GALIT
You accepted the Partition Plan in '47. Not a single Palestinian would become
a refugee...

KATE
If I might interrupt...

FARAD
The Palestinians were being massacred. Even Israeli historians admit this.

GALIT
It was war, only three years after the Holocaust. If we had lost there would
have been another wholesale slaughter of Jews.

KATE
Mr. Chairman, Madame Ambassador, excuse me. It may be more productive to
turn our attention to current problems rather than the events of 50 years ago.

FARAD
If there is room for a million Russian Jews in Israel, why isn't there room
for Palestinians who simply wish to go home?

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

We see an aerial shot of the exterior of the White House.

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
      DAY THREE

We see that C.J. is briefing the press about the talks at Camp David.

C.J.
Good afternoon. Let me give you a brief rundown of what's happened at Camp
David this morning. The delegations continue to meet to discuss a number of
issues. They will begin at 10:00 and will resume after lunch. They will end
early, as it is Friday, and Prime Minister Zahavy has invited the President
and First Lady to join the Israeli delegation for a Shabat dinner. I'll take
a few questions. Katie?

KATIE
Can you tell us what issues are being discussed and is progress being made?

C.J.
The talks include a broad range of issues and getting Israelis and Palestinians
to sit in a room together without a combat unit or trial attorney is progress.

CUT TO: EXT. - BASKETBALL COURT - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see that Charlie, Toby, Will, Josh and Bartlet are playing basketball
while discussing the negotiations. Abbey and Kate are sitting on the
sidelines watching.

WILL
The Israelis will return the territories but they want a military presence.

TOBY
The Palestinians don't get how it's going to be their house if it comes
furnished with Israeli tanks.

JOSH
Have you mentioned Germany? We've had troops there for 50 years.

TOBY
They asked how many British troops were still stationed in Philadelphia
after the American Revolution.

JOSH
Plenty. But they were, you know, shackled to the wall.

BARTLET
What about settlements?

KATE
The Israelis are hinting they'll abandon everything in Gaza but they want 75%
of the West Bank settlements to remain. Mukarat might go for it if he gets
Israeli land in exchange.

BARTLET
Sounds promising.

KATE
Yeah. Only, Mukarat wants twice as much area as the Israelis say the
settlements actually sit on.

ABBEY
How's he justifying that?

KATE
He says the Israelis took the best land. Wants 2-for-1 in exchange.

BARTLET
Dismantling terror?

WILL
The Israelis want Farad to renounce terrorism, but in Arabic on Al Jazerra. And
they want more than just a promise to disarm Hamas, they want it to happen
before they leave.

BARTLET
What do the Palestinians say?

TOBY
That Farad's renounced terrorism...

JOSH
Is that why he keeps calling for the "blood of a million martyrs," in all
his speeches?

WILL
I thought that was a problem with the interpretation.

BARTLET
Right of return?

KATE
Farad wants the right of return to apply to all Palestinians. The Israelis
are understandably concerned about 3 million Palestinians moving back in.

JOSH
Gallop did some polling in the West Bank. Found that, while refugees wanted
the right to come back, most wouldn't.

WILL
That's great. Then they won't be disappointed.

ABBEY
Well, look at the bright side: nobody shot anybody else the first day.

Bartlet shoots the basketball from about the three-point line and makes it in.

BARTLET
Okay.

WILL
Nice shot.

BARTLET
We start small. See if we can get an agreement on anything, no matter
how inconsequential. Something we can build on. I'll continue to sit out
so I can jump in later, but one small move is all we need to get things
rolling. Thanks, guys.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

Toby, Will, Kate, and Charlie leave the court. Bartlet comes to sit next to
Abbey and Josh comes over to speak with him.

JOSH
Sir, is there anything else I can do to help?

BARTLET
Go with Toby and Will; I think they need some positive reinforcement.

JOSH
Sir, should we be here?

BARTLET
Glad you're back, Josh.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

Bartlet indicates for Josh to go on. Josh leaves.

ABBEY
Jed, where's Leo?

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Galit, Kate, Farad, and the other people are in the room talking.

GALIT
The Palestinians only became refugees when our Arab neighbors refused to
accept them. 800,000 Jews were similarly expelled from Arab nations. 600,000
of them were resettled in Israel without compensation from Arab countries.

KATE
Madame Ambassador, you bring up the issue of compensation. Would Israel
be prepared...

FARAD
We are not asking for money. We want the right of return.

GALIT
We can't allow 3 million refugees the right to freely reenter.

FARAD
Of course not! Since the 19th century, Zionist leaders have advocated a
transfer of Arabs out of Palestine.

GALIT
We can not accept an unlimited right of immigration.

KATE
Perhaps we should take a break.

GALIT
If the Arab population had not been uprooted, no Jewish state could have
arisen.

FARAD
So, it was all right for Palestine to transfer its native population to
establish a Jewish state?

He stands.

FARAD
We are prepared to sacrifice, yes, but not to formalize our
dispossession. Excuse me.

He leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Zahavy, Massar, Mukarat, Toby, Will, and Josh are sitting around a table,
talking.

ZAHAVY
And the removal of our forces from the territories would create a power
vacuum. How are we to prevent rocket attacks from Palestinian-controlled areas.

MUKARAT
It would be our responsibility to gain control over our militants.

MASSAR
We've tried that before.

MUKARAT
You've never given us enough time to assert ourselves before you come rushing
back in with your tanks.

MASSAR
Well, it's almost 4:00, and we have to end early this evening for caballah
shabat.

Toby stands.

TOBY
Right. Why don't we meet back here tomorrow morning at 10:00?

Zahavy and Massar stand to leave.

ZAHAVY
Excuse me. Thank you.

Josh and Will stand after they leave.

MUKARAT
They've done everything in their power to undermine moderate leadership. Don't
they understand when the blow up leaders of Hamas with bombs, all those
Palestinian homes, they only make them stronger? Boys and girls, they no longer
want to be doctors, teachers, engineers. Now, they all want to be martyrs.

He leaves.

CUT TO: EXT. - ROAD - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see that a car is parked. A secret Service agent gets out and opens
and umbrella before opening the rear door. Leo steps out. He waves off the
umbrella as he adjusts his coat and walks around the car to head toward one
of the buildings.

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Bartlet, Kate, Josh, Will, and Toby are sitting on couches and are talking.

BARTLET
So, there's an opening on compensation for refugees?

KATE
Maybe. But Israel's not going to agree to an unlimited right of return. There
might be a pitch for most of them going to the new Palestinian state and
Israel agreeing to take in a few. Something like the 9% who told Gallop they
might want to go.

BARTLET
Okay. Work on that. Toby?

TOBY
Not much on security. The Israelis aren't ready to leave a West Bank that
isn't protected militarily.

WILL
And we're still far apart on any kind of land swap for the settlements.

JOSH
And Mukarat's sticking at 10%.

TOBY
The Israelis are saying 3%.

BARTLET
Any ideas on how to break the logjam?

We see, behind Bartlet's shoulder, Leo walk in the screen door.

JOSH
Too bad Congress isn't here. They'd just cook the books and hold a press
conference.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, you should get ready for dinner.

BARTLET
All right. We need some suggested solutions on security and settlements. That's
tonight's homework.

Bartlet leaves to get ready.

TOBY
OK. Rose Bud, after dinner. We solve world peace.

They all get up and leave except for Josh and Toby who stay to talk to Leo.

LEO
How's it going?

They say nothing.

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY
You going to talk to him?

JOSH
Somebody better do something, or this time next week, it's going to be us
who lose our right to return.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

We see that the members of the Palestinian delegation are set up in a small
area with a short level of stone part of the way around. Each man has a
rug set out in front of him, and they are standing at the very end. They
are in three rows: seven men in the back row, eight men in the middle row,
and Farad, by himself, is in the front row. Farad turns and speaks to a man
who begins reciting a prayer.

FARAD
(speaks Arabic)

MAN
(speaks Arabic)

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

We cut to inside the building where Bartlet, Abbey and the Israeli delegation
is beginning dinner. We see Maya Zahavy lighting some candles. We can still
hear the Palestinians praying.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

We see that Farad is now speaking, presumably singing some sort of hymn.

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

We see that Maya is performing the ritual to begin the dinner. She begins
praying. We can hear the Palestinians praying in the background.

MAYA ZAHAVY
(speaks Hebrew)

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

The Palestinians are still praying.

MAYA [OS]
(speaks Hebrew)

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

MAYA
(speaks Hebrew)

She finishes the prayer.

ALL
Amen.

MAYA
Shabat shalom.

ALL
Shabat shalom.

We see Zahavy pick up the wine and begin pouring.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

We see the Palestinians are now on their knees on their mats, with their
heads bowed to the ground.

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

Zahavy is speaking.

ZAHAVY
(speaks Hebrew)

We see Bartlet holding a cup of wine. We next see Zahavy using a pitcher of
water to wash his hands. He pours the water over his hands and then uses a
towel to dry them. We cut back and forth several times between the dinner
and the Palestinian worship ceremony.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

Farad is leading the worship.

FARAD
(speaks Arabic)

We see that Kate and Charlie are watching the Palestinians from a distance.

KATE
It's beautiful, isn't it? That's the law. They have to do it five times a day.

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

We see that Zahavy has uncovered the bread that Bartlet and the delegation
will eat. He picks it up and begins to pray over it.

ZAHAVY
(speaks Hebrew)

ALL
Amen.

We flash to the worship outside and then back to the dinner, where Zahavy
has cut a piece of bread and is sprinkling some sort of herb over it. We
next see him and Maya eat their piece of bread.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - DAY

We see Kate and Charlie talking and then we pan over to see the Palestinians
getting up from their prayer and worship.

KATE
The tragedy is that the Palestinians and the Jews are so much alike.

CHARLIE
How's that?

KATE
All through history no one's wanted either of them.

CUT TO: INT. - DINING ROOM - DAY

We see the people in the room sit down at the table for dinner.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. - YARD - CAMP DAVID - DAY
      DAY FOUR

We see the sprinklers activate at the lawn at Camp David. We hear C.J. giving
a briefing.

C.J. [VO]
Good morning. Let me, as has become my custom, give you a tantalizing yet
maddeningly generic rundown of what's gone on since yesterday afternoon's
briefing.

CUT TO: INT. - CABIN - DAY

We see that several men, either from the White House, the Israeli delegation,
or the Palestinian delegation, asleep around the coffee table. C.J. can
still be heard briefing the press.

C.J.
The President had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Zahavy. I think
this was sometime after 10:00 pm. This was at the Prime Minister's cabin. The
President then hosted Chairman Farad at his cabin. I won't say whether they
played the obligatory game of twister.

We pan around to where we see Toby, Josh, and Kate walking into the cabin. They
are talking.

TOBY
Fixed positions won't work.

JOSH
How long will they be there?

KATE
I don't know, 4 years.

TOBY
Farad's going to hate it, Zahavy's going to hate it even more.

KATE
Do you have a better idea?

JOSH
Yeah: wait till they die. I'll be free the whole millennium.

TOBY
Two old paleo-nationalists who have been clawing each other's eyes out for
50 years; they don't want to deal. What are they going to do for fun? Swap
recipes for Matzapri?

JOSH
I hear the lawn-bowling's great in Tel Aviv.

TOBY
With human pins, apparently.

Leo walks in. He looks as though he is sick.

LEO
How's it coming?

JOSH
Are you alright? You're looking a little bit...

LEO
Those left-over taquitos Will found in here last night. Anybody got an antacid,
or maybe an aunt who knows how to cook?

Toby tosses him a pill bottle.

TOBY
Keep 'em. I got more back in the room.

LEO
So?

JOSH
Kate has an idea on security.

KATE
Israelis pull out of the West Bank but get to keep troops in fixed positions
for three or four years. After that, they fall back to Israel but get to
keep some sort of early warning post for monitoring.

LEO
Okay.

KATE
Excuse me?

LEO
I said okay.

KATE
Where were you for the last three hours?

LEO
Let's take it out for a walk.

TOBY
Walking a dog is a perfect analogy.
KATE
Toby's not a fan.

TOBY
Well, Zahavy may go for it, but every time we get close to anywhere, Massar
jumps in.

LEO
The Defense Minister?

Leo's phone starts ringing.

LEO
You got to split 'em up.

TOBY
How are we supposed to do that?

LEO
I don't know. You'll think of something.

He answers his phone and walks off.

CUT TO: EXT. - YARD - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see a golf cart pull up driven by two men. Toby and Massar are on the back,
both carrying shotguns.

MASSAR
I've always wanted to try skeet shooting. Do you shoot often.

TOBY
Yeah. You know, once or twice a week, when it's in season.

MAN
Here we are, gentlemen.

The man hands them some shells.

MASSAR
So, tell me Toby: how exactly does this work?

TOBY
Well, they hurl a couple of clay pigeons, and we shoot 'em. Unless they hurl
them the wrong direction, then we duck.

Massar laughs.

MAN
You know how to fire a gun, sir?

TOBY
Yeah. I'm fine.

MAN
Ready, Mr. Minister?

Massar cocks his gun and aims.

MASSAR
Pull.

The man releases the skeet and Massar shoots and hits it. Toby winces and
covers his hear.

TOBY
How long were you in the Army?

MASSAR
I still am. Every Israeli citizen is in the reserves. Your turn.

Toby loads his gun and closes it.

MASSAR
You sure you know how to do this?

TOBY
I know back in Israel you play this game with Cobra gunships, but I'm fine.

He prepares to shoot and Massar glares at Toby's stance.

TOBY
What?

MASSAR
You may now want to rest like this, you have to stand more, you know, firm.

TOBY
Yeah, well, this is the way we do it in Brooklyn. Pull.

The skeet is released and Toby shoots. The recoil from the gun knocks him
over on his back.

CUT TO: EXT. - LUNCH TABLE - DAY

Josh and Kate are meeting with Zahavy. They have already told him their plan
and are waiting for a response from him.

ZAHAVY
The fixed positions in the West Bank for four years?

KATE
Maybe less, if things go well.

ZAHAVY
Then how many monitoring sights after?

JOSH
Two or three, so you can keep an eye on the Jordanian border and the
Palestinians.

There is a long pause and it seems as though he might not go for it.

KATE
It could be more than four years, if that's what you're...

ZAHAVY
We would need a mechanism to deal with emergency developments.

We see a look of disbelief on both their faces as though they were sure he
would not agree.

CUT TO: EXT. - ASPEN TERRACE - DAY

Bartlet is seated and Josh, Will, and Kate are standing around him. They
have told him what Zahavy said.

BARTLET
He'll do it?

JOSH
Some version of it, yes, sir.

BARTLET
And Farad?

KATE
Farad'll be the last to sign on.

WILL
Mukarat will probably support it if we can get him away from Farad.

BARTLET
Where are we on right of return?

WILL
Israelis won't do an unlimited right. Farad is standing on principle.

KATE
I can work on him. I think he likes me.

BARTLET
Josh, Will, get back in with Zahavy before Toby has to start feeding the
clay pigeons and get him to commit on security. OK, let's go.

They walk off as Bartlet stands. We see Leo standing behind them waiting to
talk to Bartlet.

BARTLET
We may just have our tennis match.

Leo says nothing.

BARTLET
You don't think so?

LEO
We haven't got to the tough part.

BARTLET
We're making progress.

LEO
Yes, sir, you are and that's laudable.

BARTLET
Laudable? You make it sound like an honorarium from some two-bit chiropractic
college in Arizona.

LEO
When are you planning to discuss Jerusalem?

BARTLET
That'll be the last thing.

LEO
Because it's the only thing that...

BARTLET
Damn it, don't you think I know that?

There is a pause, in which neither say anything.

LEO
I'll go see if I can get Galit to give us a number on compensation.

Leo walks off, as does Bartlet.

CUT TO: EXT. - BRIDGE - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see a walkway bridge is built over a stream. We pan up to see Farad waiting
at the middle of the bridge, near the side. Kate walks over to him from one
end of the bridge.

KATE
Mr. Chairman, I know how difficult it would be for you to even appear to be
abandoning your principle. It's just not reasonable to ask the Israelis to
allow an unlimited number of refugees to return.

FARAD
I was born in the city of Safra. Do you know Safra? It's in the mountains
of Habrigaly. I was eight years old when the leaders left. There were 52
Arabs in Safra but only a thousand three hundred Jews. Within a month, the
Haganah had taken over the city. My eldest sister, Amira, was killed. The
body of my brother, Aziz, was found hanging from a burned Cyprus tree. We
fled to Syria; lived in tents, ate the United Nations handouts and surplus
American cheese. I still remember the view of the valley from the roof of
our house; the smell of the pomegranates; the sound of children playing in
our orchard. The home of my father, of my aunts and uncles, they are now
art galleries and bed and breakfasts. Will I get to go home, Ms. Harper?

KATE
No, sir, probably not. But is that worth not having any home at all?

CUT TO: EXT. - LUNCH TERRACE - DAY

Kate has just got back from talking with Farad. Josh walks up to her and Will,
Toby, and Bartlet are standing near her.

JOSH
You got Farad to go along on right of return?

KATE
I think it's doable.

WILL
I'm taking her with me the next time I buy a car.

TOBY
That leaves us with the big one.

KATE
Any chance we can just give Jerusalem to the Swiss?

JOSH
So, who goes in?

BARTLET
I do.

Bartlet turns and walks into the cabin behind them.

CUT TO: EXT. - TERRACE - FARAD'S CABIN - DAY

Bartlet is on the terrace talking with Farad.

BARTLET
Shared sovereignty of Jerusalem is the only realistic approach.

FARAD
No. If anyone led you to believe we could agree...

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, do you really want to see your people oppressed for another
generation? Shared custody of the city and its holy sites is the only...

FARAD
Why do you continue to support Israel? Hatred of America grows because of
this, and not just in the Muslim countries.

BARTLET
I've done more to support the Palestinian cause than anyone who's ever sat
in my chair.

FARAD
The Haram Sharif, the Dome of the Rock, stands on the site where the prophet
Mohammed landed in his divine journey from  Mecca to Jerusalem.

BARTLET
Mr. Chairman, there isn't a single member of your delegation who doesn't
think turning down the offer of a Palestinian homeland in 1947 was lunacy,
a colossal mistake. Please, do not make the same mistake today.

CUT TO: EXT. - WOODED AREA - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see Josh and Toby tossing a football while discussing the situation.

JOSH
He's not going to do it. Farad's elevated being a victim into an art
form. What?

TOBY
Nothing.

JOSH
Come on, you're not starting to buy what he's selling, too. He's a terrorist.

TOBY
With some legitimate grievances.

JOSH
Please.

TOBY
What, now suddenly you're Jewish. I don't remember seeing you at temple.

JOSH
1938, millions of men, women, and children running for their lives from gas
chambers tried to seek refuge in any country that would take them; no one
would, not even America.

TOBY
So they settle in the middle of a region that still believes in public
stonings and harems? The Palestinians are the Jews of the Arab world.

JOSH
Even with the bombs Israel is the one place it's okay to be Jewish.

TOBY
And here.

JOSH
German Jews in the '20s were mighty comfortable.

TOBY
Well, this isn't Germany. This is America.

JOSH
Home of the KKK.

TOBY
Where you and I work in the White House to make sure the Justice department
rips their Jew-hating hoods off.

Will walks up.

WILL
Bartlet got Farad.

They follow Will back up to the cabin area.

CUT TO: EXT. - WOODS - DAY

Bartlet is walking along a path with Zahavy and they are talking about
Jerusalem.

BARTLET
The general principle would be that Arab areas are Palestinian and Jewish
areas are Israeli; Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall, Palestinian
sovereignty over the Haram. There would have to be a firm commitment from
both parties not to excavate under the Haram or behind the wall, of course.

ZAHAVY
You have kept us here for five days, negotiating contriving little things
we didn't want to do but we have tried, struggled to find a common ground
because we value your friendship and that of the United States; but I have
taken a solemn oath before God and my people not to give up Jerusalem. I
told that on the first day. I told you.

He begins gesticulating with great fervor to try to get his point across
to Bartlet.

ZAHAVY [cont.]
And yet you continue to talk and to talk; you have not been
listening. Mr. President, my right eye will fall out, my right arm will fall
off before I ever sign a document giving up Jerusalem.

BARTLET
Mr. Prime Minister, please listen.

ZAHAVY
No, there have been enough thoughts, Mr. President. We are going home. Thank
you.

He walks off, leaving Bartlet alone. We see Bartlet look off the side of
the bridge walkway they were standing on and into the water.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - CABIN - NIGHT

We see and hear that Bartlet, Leo, Kate, Toby, Will, Josh, Charlie and Abbey
are talking.

WILL

No, no, no. They're not going to go for it.


KATE

They might.


WILL
They won't.

TOBY
We go to Mukarat, convince him to take something less than sovereignty over
the Arab sections of the city.

WILL
Something less, like what?

TOBY
I don't know some sort of custodial arrangement.

WILL
How about a floral arrangement? "Best wishes for the 93rd Interfadah."

CHARLIE
State put off the Israeli departure until 8:00 in the morning.

BARTLET
What'd they tell them?

CHARLIE
That State police needed 10 hours to secure the road.

BARTLET
Call C.J. Tell her there'll be an announcement in the morning.

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Have you started working on a statement?

TOBY
"A cycle that cannot be broken overnight," "A step toward..." insert your
favorite platitude here.

ABBEY
There's always regional calamity.

BARTLET
All right, everyone, let's get a good night's sleep.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President. Good night.

They get up and leave. Leo walks over to talk with Bartlet.

LEO
I'll have C.J. work on some post-mortems, get our side of the story out; maybe
a one-on-one with Times or Newsweek. [pause] They weren't ready. Goodnight,
Mr. President.


He leaves. Abbey sits down on the arm of the chair and kisses Bartlet on
the back of the head.

CUT TO: EXT. - DINNER SITE - NIGHT

We see that several people are having dinner inside an open-air structure. The
camera pans around to where we can see Josh trying to make a call on his
cell phone. Kate walks up to talk to him.

KATE
Cell phone service sucks up here.

JOSH
Yeah, not many good spots; this is usually one of them.

KATE
Who are you trying to call at 2:00 in the morning? Someone you hate, I hope.

JOSH
It's Germany. It's morning over there already.

KATE
Is your assistant doing better?

JOSH
She may fly back on Wednesday.

KATE
It's a search for two freedoms: for Israel, the freedom from terror; for
the Palestinians, the freedom from Israel. That's what F.M. Nocman called
it. His book on the Six-Day War was pretty...

JOSH
What? Boring? Overwritten?

KATE
Find Toby and Will. I'll meet you at Aspen.

She gets up to walk away.

JOSH
What?

KATE
Get Toby and Will.

CUT TO: INT. - ASPEN CABIN - NIGHT

Kate is talking to Bartlet. Josh, Will, Toby, and Abbey are also there.

KATE
After the Six-day War, the Israelis offered to give the U.N. diplomatic
status and immunities in the holy sights in Jerusalem.

WILL
So?

KATE
So if they were willing to do it in '67, why not now? They give the Muslim
holy sights the status of diplomatic missions. The Israelis can keep all
the sovereignty the want, they still can't enter without permission from
the Palestinians.

BARTLET
So the Palestinians would have a sovereign-like state that was inviolable
like a foreign embassy.

KATE
The Palestinians'll love it because it gives them the same custodial status
over the Haram like the Saudis have over sights like Mecca and Medina. There's
only one catch. When the Israelis offered it the first time they wanted
peacekeepers as part of the deal, in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank.

ABBEY
The U.N. will cough up peacekeepers if it will solve the Middle-East crisis.

TOBY
It can't be the U.N. U.N. peacekeepers have no credibility with the
Israelis. They let Egypt attack Israel through the Sinai in '67. It's going
to have to be us.

JOSH
How many troops?

WILL
The Israelis have around 20,000 in the West Bank and Gaza.

KATE
The Europeans will probably pitch in, maybe contribute 10%.

JOSH
18,000 American troops patrolling the PLO's backyard. [pause] Where the hell
is Leo?

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S CABIN - NIGHT

Leo's phone can be heard ringing. He turns on the lamp on his bedside table
and looks at his watch.

CUT TO: INT. - WASHROOM - LEO'S CABIN - NIGHT

Leo flips on the lights in his bathroom and we see his reflection in the
mirror. We see that he is not looking very good and looks as though he has
had a rough night.

CUT TO: INT. - ASPEN CABIN - NIGHT

Bartlet, Abbey, Toby, Will, Josh, and Kate are still talking. Leo comes in
the front door.

WILL
How are the other Arab nations going to feel about this?

ABBEY
The King of Jordan will put up with some new neighbors. It'll give him peace
and quiet in his own backyard.

JOSH
And folks in the West Bank are just going to roll out the welcome mat for
G.I. Joe when he climbs out of his Humvee in Ramallah?

ABBEY
Well, if we're going to stay up all night, I'm going to order some coffee
and get dressed.

She gets up and walks away.

JOSH
Is this really our job? Sending American teenagers into that breech.

LEO
What are we talking about?

WILL
About putting an American peacekeeping force in the territories.

LEO
And we think that's a good idea?

JOSH
Some of us do.

KATE
The Palestinians want the Israelis out of the territories and the Israelis
don't want to leave the Palestinians there alone. We need an outside force
to secure the borders, to ensure a smooth transition.

LEO
You think Congress is going to authorize that?

KATE
They've been asking for a show of force.

LEO
We'd be throwing ourselves into a conflict we don't understand and give
religious fanatics even more to scream about. Not to mention political capital,
economic costs.

BARTLET
It shouldn't be our job, but no one else can do it.

LEO
Can I speak to you privately for a moment?

Bartlet gets up and he and Leo walk outside. We follow them, and we can
still hear the others talking in the cabin.


LEO
I can't support this decision. For a short period we may be welcome but what
happens when we have to start kicking in doors, declare martial law?

BARTLET
Once they establish a rule of law and their economy settles down, they'll
be fine.

LEO
This isn't a romp in the desert, you're committing American lives to something
that may go on for decades!

BARTLET [yelling]
How are we not involved now?!

He quiets and leans against the railing.

BARTLET
We can't keep having this argument.

LEO
No, sir, we can't.


There is a pause in which both say nothing. Then Leo speaks.

LEO
My counsel is no longer of use to you. Perhaps it's time...

BARTLET
So, if I disagree with your advice you have to threaten me.

LEO
This is your own League of Nations. And it'll ruin you like it ruined Wilson.

BARTLET
Okay. I'll need your successor in place before you leave.

LEO
I'll get you some names.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Bartlet walks back into the cabin as Josh walks out. He walks over to the
bridge walkway where Leo is standing. Leo doesn't look good.

JOSH
Is everything all right?

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
Is he still going to do it?

LEO
You should get back in there, find out what the President needs...

JOSH
Are you sure you're okay?

LEO
I just need some air. Go.

Josh does not move.

LEO
Go.

Josh walks back inside. Leo unbuttons his coat and accidentally rips a
button off. He turns and begins walking away, looking as though he is in some
pain. He walks slowly. As he comes to the middle of the bridge he is crossing
he stops. He grabs his chest and begins double in pain. He grabs his chest
because of the pain. When the pain seems to have passed he begins walking away.

CUT TO: EXT. - WOODS - EARLY MORNING

We see Leo walking through the woods. His breathing is labored and he is
obviously in a great deal of pain. At one point we see through his eyes,
seeing that his vision is slightly impaired and he is stumbling.
 As he is walking, he grabs a nearby tree and his face contorts in pain. He
 lets out a silent scream. After a few moments he looks as though the pain has
 passed and he even shows a slight smile. He walks a few steps and the pain
 comes back. He grabs another tree and this time actually lets out an audible
 scream of pain. We see him double up in pain and then, from a distance, we see
 him fall to the ground. He rolls over in an attempt to get up but does not.

FADE TO: EXT. - ZAHAVY'S CABIN - DAY
      DAY FIVE

We see Bartlet waiting outside Zahavy's cabin. Massar is at the door.

MASSAR
Just a second, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

MASSAR
Zahavy. (speaks Hebrew)

Zahavy comes to the door.

BARTLET
Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister.

ZAHAVY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you for seeing me.

ZAHAVY
Of course.

BARTLET
Can we take a walk?

Zahavy comes out and he and Bartlet leave to go for a walk.

CUT TO: EXT. - PATHWAY - DAY

Bartlet and Zahavy are walking, preceded by a Secret Service agent.

BARTLET
Eli, I had another talk last night. The difficulty with...

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

We see C.J. walk to the podium to begin the briefing.

C.J.
Good morning, everybody, if you could settle down, please. I'm pleased to
announce that this afternoon at 2:00 Prime Minister Zahavy, Chairman Farad,
and President Bartlet...

The reporters begin wildly screaming for C.J.'s attention.

C.J. [cont.]
... will hold a joint press conference in the Rose Garden to describe a
tentative accord that's been reached between the parties.

CUT TO: EXT. - HELICOPTER LANDING AREA - CAMP DAVID - DAY

We see Marine One is ready for takeoff. Bartlet and Abbey, followed by Charlie,
get onto the plane.

CUT TO: EXT. - ROADSIDE - DAY

We see the Suburbans are getting ready to leave. Josh, Toby, and Will are
talking as they carry their things to the cars. Kate is waiting by the car
when they get there.

WILL
Congress won't approve it.

JOSH
They don't have to approve it; we're not declaring war. We're not even trying
to build one of those aquatic history museums.

WILL
They still have to fund it.

TOBY
It'll never get that far. Farad'll find some way to trip over his own shoes
before we even get a chance to re-sew them.

WILL
No round trip on Marine One?

KATE
Yeah, it's a shame.

TOBY
You talk to Leo this morning?

JOSH
I couldn't find him. He must've headed back early.

TOBY
Any idea how he wants us to handle this?

JOSH
No. I'll try calling him.

They climb into the chopper and he gets his cell phone out and dials
Leo. Someone shuts Josh's door for him.

CUT TO: EXT. - TAKEOFF - DAY

We see Marine One taking off and Bartlet staring out the window. We watch
it rise and begin to fly off.

CUT TO: EXT. - WOODS - DAY

We see the chopper fly over the trees as the camera pans around to the
ground. Leo's phone can be heard ringing as the camera moves across the
forest floor. Nothing can be seen although Leo's phone continues to ring.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
