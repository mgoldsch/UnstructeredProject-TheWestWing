TEASER

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet and his staff are preparing for the State of the Union address. The
President,
from behind the podium, reads the speech from the TelePrompTer.

BARTLET
With nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate
of inflation,
the highest home ownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30
years and the
lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957. [beat] I stand before you to report
that
America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our
history. For the
first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of 290
million
dollars just ten years ago...

TOBY
Billion dollars.

Toby interrupts the President. Leo is seated beside him.

BARTLET
What?

TOBY
290 billion.

BARTLET
What'd I say?

TOBY
You said million, but let's move on.

BARTLET
I said million?

TOBY
Yep.

BARTLET
[clears throat] From a deficit of 290 billion dollars, just ten... it says
'million'
on the TelePrompTer, by the way.

TOBY
Sam?

Sam is behind them controlling the TelePrompTer with several White House
staffers.

SAM
Our fault.

BARTLET
L-Let's take it back.

The President coughs hard. He is sweating, and he looks tired.

BARTLET [cont.]
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President...

Behind all of them, Josh and C.J. are watching the President from a
television.

BARTLET [OS]
Members of the 106th Congress, distinguished guests...

JOSH
He doesn't look so good.

C.J.
Yeah.

JOSH
He's pale and he's sweating.

C.J.
I know.

JOSH
You think he's getting sick?

C.J.
I don't know.

JOSH
Are his glands swollen?

C.J.
Damn.

JOSH
What?

C.J
You know what I forgot to do today?

JOSH
What?

C.J.
I forgot to feel the President's glands.

JOSH
Do you think the joke reflex you use as a defense mechanism is why you have
so much
trouble keeping a man?

C.J.
You know...?

JOSH
I'm saying, we're 44 hours away from the State of the Union, and he doesn't
look so good.

Bartlet continues to read from the TelePrompTer.

BARTLET
...And how do we make the American dream of opportunity a reality for all? I
came to
this hallowed chamber one year ago, and I see we're spelling 'hallowed' with
a pound
sign in the middle of it.

SAM
We'll fix that.

BARTLET
The pound sign's silent?

LEO
Move on, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission: to restore the
American
dream for all our people, as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities
open to us
in the 321st century... Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn't it?

SAM
[heads to the podium] Leo...

LEO
Let's take a break.

BARTLET
We meant 'stronger' here, right?

SAM
What's it say?

BARTLET
I'm proud to report our country's stranger than it was a year ago?

SAM
That's a typo.

BARTLET
Could go either way.

TOBY
Sam?

SAM
Taking care of it. [leaves]

Josh and C.J. approach the President. Bartlet and his staff start to walk
away.

JOSH
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yes, sir.

JOSH
How do you feel?

BARTLET
Why is everyone asking me that today?

JOSH
But you don't look so good.

BARTLET
I'm fine.

JOSH
You're pale and you're perspiring.

BARTLET
I'm fine.

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

C.J.
You should be taking something, sir.

BARTLET
I'm taking many things, C.J.

C.J.
What are you taking?

BARTLET
I don't know. My wife hands me pills. I swallow them with water.

SAM
Sir?

BARTLET
Vitamin C. Vitamin B. Is it possible I'm taking something called 'euthanasia'?

SAM
Echinacea?

BARTLET
Ah, that sounds more like it... Toby?

TOBY
Yes, sir.

C.J.
Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'm taking pills, C.J.

C.J.
Are you actually taking them, or are you just carrying them around in your
pocket?

BARTLET
[beat] You know, carrying them around in my pocket was a pretty big step
for me.

C.J.
You got to take the pills.

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

BARTLET
'How do we make the American dream a reality for all who work for it.'

TOBY
Oh, come on.

BARTLET
You got to add, 'who work for it.'

TOBY
Sir?

JOSH
That was me.

TOBY
We've decided this two weeks ago.

JOSH
We've seen some pretty compelling polling samples. We need 'people who work
for it'
and I'll tell you what else.

TOBY
What?

JOSH
'The era of big government is over.'

TOBY
[stops] Oh, when did this happen?

JOSH
This morning, we had a meeting.

TOBY
We decided to offend poor people?

JOSH
The people we're offending won't be watching the State of the Union.

TOBY
Yeah, I can't imagine why not.

The group continues to walk. They stop around the corner of THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
It's what they're listening for in welfare reforms, so screw it.

TOBY
Alright, but when you get visited in the middle of the night by the ghost
of Christmas
future, don't come running to me.

BARTLET
Damn, Toby, 'cause you're exactly who I was gonna come running to.

TOBY
You don't look so good.

BARTLET
Well, I'm gazing in the 321st century, man. There's a lot on my mind.

LEO
Let's finish up in here. [indicates the Roosevelt Room]

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Oh, dear God. I will take the pills, C.J.

C.J.
Will you take them now?

BARTLET
Yes. I will go to the Oval Office, and pour a glass of water from the Steuben
glass
pitcher, which was a gift from the Christian Charity Network there, Skippy.

TOBY
Mr. President?

BARTLET
I'm just saying, before you start calling me, Ebenezer Bartlet, remember,
I got a
really nice glass pitcher for just, you know, being a good guy.

TOBY
Well, you turned me right around on that one, Mr. President.

C.J.
Sir?

BARTLET
[waves the bag of pills in the air] I will take the pills.

Bartlet goes inside THE OVAL OFFICE and closes the door. Sam, Leo, Toby,
Josh, and C.J.
are left standing outside.

SAM
You know, here's the thing.

LEO
Hmm?

SAM
We haven't been invited yet.

TOBY
What do you mean?

SAM
Technically, the Speaker of the House invites the President to deliver the
State of
the Union.

TOBY
And we haven't been invited yet?

SAM
Not yet.

LEO
Is somebody seeing to this?

SAM
I'll take care of it.

TOBY
Good, cause you know, we want to be able to report that the country's a lot
stranger
than it was a year ago.

SAM
I'll never be able to live it down.

LEO
No.

Leo and C.J. laugh. CRASH! The staffers heard the sound of broken glass from
inside
THE OVAL OFFICE. They quickly go inside. We see the President lying face down
unconscious in his carpet. Beside him is the broken Steuben glass pitcher
and the
spilled water. We hear a Secret Service Agent.

AGENT [OS]
Liberty's down. We're in the Oval.

C.J.
Get a doctor.

Some of the group try to feel the President's pulse from his neck.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Bartlet has regained consciousness. He is seated in a chair. The physician
on duty,
ADMIRAL HACKETT,  has just taken his temperature. The staff is around them.

HACKETT
Well, his temperature's 101.9. I'm fairly sure he's got the flu, but I want
to take
him to Bethesda for a cardiogram.

BARTLET
I don't need a cardiogram.

LEO
Let's go.

BARTLET
I got dizzy.

LEO
We're going to the hospital.

BARTLET
I didn't have a heart attack, Leo. I got the flu, and I don't need a
cardiogram.

HACKETT
I also want blood work and a chest x-ray.

LEO
[to Hackett] You think it's pneumonia?

HACKETT
No, I think it's the flu, but I don't want to fool around.

BARTLET
Leo, I'm fine.

Mrs. Landingham approaches. She gives him a piece of paper with a note on it.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham... Mrs. Landingham how do I look to you?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You're a very handsome man, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[to Leo] See?

LEO
[to Hackett] What do you think?

HACKETT
Uh, it can wait till morning, but I want to stay with him for an hour or two.

LEO
Do the blood work, send it to the lab, get the cardiogram and chest x-ray
tomorrow.

HACKETT
Sure.

LEO
[to Bartlet] You're going to bed.

BARTLET
Can't yet.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Situation Room. [gives Leo the note, which he reads]

LEO
Alright, let's do this, and then you're going to bed.
[to Hackett] We'll meet you in the residence in a few minutes.

The President stands up. He gets dizzy again and almost falls down. Everyone
tries
to grab him.

JOSH
Whoa!

BARTLET
Just a little joke.

TOBY
You're a real cut-up there, Mr. President.

BARTLET
101.9 and I still got it.

SAM
Yes, indeed, sir.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
The Joint Chiefs of Staff are inside, including the chairman, Admiral
Fitzwallace.
They are waiting for the President.

FITZWALLACE
I'm gonna tell him 'steady and not egregious, sir.' We're all okay with that?

MITCH
Yes, sir.

TOM
Yeah.

OFFICER 1
Admiral?

FITZWALLACE
What do you got?

OFFICER 1
We got the 2nd, 3rd, the 103rd, the 106th, and the 107th.

FITZWALLACE
Thank you.

The double doors open. In comes Bartlet, followed by Leo. The Joint Chiefs
of Staff
all stand up.

BARTLET
Anybody know if the Celtics won tonight?

MITCH
We can get that information, sir. [signals an officer to go to the phone
while all sit]

LEO
What's going on?

FITZWALLACE
Sir, there's been steady but no egregious clashing along the cease-fire
line. If you
look at the photo-recon analysis, you'll see India has moved new units into
their four
structures at the border.

BARTLET
It was a two-week cease-fire. There's four days left.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, they're getting ready.

BARTLET
What's Intel saying about the Pakistanis?

TOM
They're desperately concerned that if the Indians continue their offensive,
they won't
be able to defend the capital with conventional forces.

LEO
Is this just whining or it's for real?

FITZWALLACE
Bazin's given command control of some of their nuclear weapons to field
commanders in
theater, but I think they're just trying to get our attention.

BARTLET
They've got mine.

LEO
And they've got China's.

FITZWALLACE
Sir, I'm gonna scramble the B-1's out of Manila, and put the 49th tactical
on recon on
ready alert.

BARTLET
I'm going to bed. But somebody call me if there's movement.

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet and Leo head for the door. The officer just got off the phone.

OFFICER 2
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

OFFICER 2
Celtics lost in overtime.

BARTLET
Ugh. Good night.

JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet and Leo leave.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Mandy and Danny are inside.

MANDY
That was very cute.

DANNY
So, I grow the rest of the beard back?

MANDY
Yeah.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
[comes in] Hello.

MANDY
C.J., don't you think Danny looked very cute with the full beard?

C.J.
I actually never thought about it.

DANNY
Well, take your time.

C.J.
What do you need?

DANNY
Actually, I came by to see my fish.

C.J.
The fish is fine, and I need my office.

DANNY
I'm leaving?

C.J.
Yes.

DANNY
Okay.

MANDY
Good night.

DANNY
Good night.

C.J.
[dryly] He gave me a fish a few weeks ago... that one there. [looks at Gail]

MANDY
C.J., it wouldn't kill you to be a little friendlier to him.

C.J.
Doesn't seem to kill you.

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J.
What do you need?

MANDY
Are you kidding me?

C.J.
Yes.

MANDY
C.J.?

C.J.
I was kidding.

MANDY
You sounded serious.

C.J.
I'm very dry.

MANDY
The story's gonna break tomorrow.

C.J.
Leo?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
How do you know?

MANDY
It's on the Internet.

C.J.
The whole thing?

MANDY
Yeah.

C.J.
I'll go talk to him. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo comes in. Margaret follows him.

MARGARET
We weren't invited?

LEO
That's right.

MARGARET
I thought it was a Constitutional requirement.

LEO
It is.

MARGARET
Then why do we have to be invited?

LEO
It's a technicality.

MARGARET
I don't...

LEO
It dates back to Parliament! What do you want from me?

MARGARET
Okay. [starts to leave]

LEO
Also, remind Josh to pick a guy.

MARGARET
Pick a guy? [writes it down]

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
He'll know what that means?

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
Cause I don't know.

LEO
Margaret!

MARGARET
Okay. [heads out]

C.J.
[comes in] Excuse me.

LEO
Oh, hey, C.J.

C.J.
Hey.

LEO
What's going on?

C.J.
How's the President?

LEO
He's in bed. Hackett's up there with him.

C.J.
Does the first lady know?

LEO
She cancelled her trip. She's on her way from Andrews.

C.J.
Leo.

LEO
It's gonna break... tomorrow?

C.J.
Yeah, it's on the Internet right now.

LEO
Okay.

C.J.
Why don't we do a preemptive...

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
You'll talk to the press in the morning?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
I'm gonna work with you first, okay?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay... [looks for a second] Okay. [leaves]

CUT TO:

INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bartlet is sitting up in his bed talking on the phone. Admiral Hackett
prepares for a
blood test as Charlie stands watch.

BARTLET
[into phone] It tested very well. I'm not saying we're doing it, Toby. I
just want to
try it and see how it reads. The era of big government is over... All
right. Thanks.

Bartlet hangs up the phone. He folds his arm when Hackett finished the blood
test.

CHARLIE
How you feeling, sir?

BARTLET
I'm feeling roughly the same as I was feeling when you asked me four minutes
ago.

CHARLIE
I'm sorry.

BARTLET
It's okay. This isn't the worst of it, Charlie. The worst of it's coming up
the stairs
right now.

On cue, the bedroom door opens. Abbey comes in.

ABBEY
Hello.

BARTLET
Hello.

CHARLIE
Good evening, ma'am.

ABBEY
[puts her jacket and bag on a chair] Hey, Charlie. How you doing?

HACKETT
Ma'am, I'm Admiral Hackett. I was on duty when it happened. [offers hand]

ABBEY
[shakes hands] Good to meet you, Admiral. Charlie, would you mind getting
my bag please?

Charlie does. Abbey takes a clipboard from Hackett. The President tries to
get her attention.

BARTLET
Abbey?

ABBEY
[looking at clipboard] Oh, well. 101.9.

HACKETT
Yes, ma'am.

ABBEY
When's the last time you checked?

HACKETT
About an hour ago.

ABBEY
Pulse and pressure?

HACKETT
The pressure dropped before he fainted, but it's coming back.

ABBEY
105 over 70.

HACKETT
Yes.

ABBEY
I want to put him on an IV/saline and vitamin solution. [to Jed] Honey,
you still dizzy?

BARTLET
I was wondering when you were gonna notice me.

ABBEY
Are you still dizzy?

BARTLET
No.

ABBEY
He's lying. Give him Flumadine, 100 milligrams, twice a day.

HACKETT
Yes, ma'am.

ABBEY
Thank you, admiral. Would you mind waiting outside for a minute?

HACKETT
No, ma'am. [leaves]

ABBEY
Thanks, Charlie. [pause] Charlie, would you mind waiting outside for a minute?

CHARLIE
No, ma'am. Do you need anything?

ABBEY
No, thanks very much.

Charlie leaves and closes the door.

BARTLET
You're very sexy when you're in doctor mode you know that? Give me an
IV/saline
solution and 100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat. [beat] I could jump you
right now.

ABBEY
I could kill you right now.

BARTLET
My thing's more fun.

ABBEY
[checks his eyes] It took you 25 minutes to call me.

BARTLET
Fitzwallace called me in the Situation Room. There was more movement in
Kashmir.

ABBEY
I don't care if Canada invaded Michigan, Jed. You call me.

BARTLET
Abbey?

ABBEY
Stop talking.

BARTLET
I broke the Steuben glass pitcher in the Oval Office.

ABBEY
It's okay.

BARTLET
Seriously, Abbey, I'm fine.

ABBEY
You could've hit your head on something. [gives her husband an injection]

BARTLET
[groans] But I didn't.

ABBEY
[quietly] Was it like the time in Nantucket?

BARTLET
Yeah.

ABBEY
Or was it like the time at my parents?

BARTLET
I really don't remember.

ABBEY
It's all right. Close your eyes. You're gonna be asleep in a minute.

Abbey takes the pillow from behind Bartlet, who lies down.

BARTLET
Fitzwallace says the Pakistanis are giving command control to some nuclear
weapons
to the field.

ABBEY
It's okay. Leo's in the West Wing.

BARTLET
I'm really sorry about the pitcher.

ABBEY
Just go to sleep, baby.

BARTLET
I could jump you right now.

ABBEY
Yeah, sure you could.

Bartlet falls to sleep. Abbey, fighting back tears, sits on a chair and
looks around
the room.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is talking on the phone.

JOSH
[into phone] I don't think it's being sorted in the mailroom. It's an
invitation to
the President to address Congress. I'm assuming it was
hand-delivered. [listens]
Thank you.

Donna knocks at the door.

JOSH
Yes?

DONNA
Margaret came by.

JOSH
Yes.

Josh goes out the door into his BULLPEN AREA. Donna follows.

DONNA
She said Leo said to remind you you need to pick a guy.

JOSH
Right.

DONNA
She said you'd know what that means.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Do you know what that means?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
I don't know what that means.

JOSH
Someone from the line of succession is required to be absent from the State
of the Union.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
Donna?

DONNA
Wait, I know why.

They walk to the NORTHWEST LOBBY.

DONNA
So if somebody blows up the building, nobody's...

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
Who are you gonna pick?

JOSH
Who do you think I should pick?

DONNA
I think you should pick me.

JOSH
You think so?

DONNA
Yeah, I'll be good.

JOSH
And where exactly do you fall in the line of succession?

DONNA
If somebody blows up the Capitol Building, I'd imagine I'd move up a few
slots.

JOSH
Fair point.

They open the door to a HALLWAY.

DONNA
So who's it gonna be?

JOSH
Roger Tribby.

DONNA
The secretary of agriculture?

JOSH
Yes. [stops] Listen. Be sweet to Margaret and Leo today. This might not be
the worst
day of their lives, but it's got to be in the top five.

DONNA
Okay.

JOSH
See ya later.

Donna goes the other way. Josh continues walking.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh comes in and closes the door. Leo is reading a speech that was prepared.
They're rehearsing for his press conference. Sam and C.J. are seated on the
couch.

LEO
I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for the people in my
life...

JOSH
When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings?

LEO
A.A. meetings?

C.J.
Don't say A.A. if they don't say A.A.

JOSH
[sits] When you left Sierra Tucson, did you start attending meetings?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
Do you still attend them?

LEO
Yes.

C.J., Sam, Josh are surprised.

C.J.
Where?

LEO
I won't answer that.

C.J.
How often?

LEO
I won't answer that, either.

JOSH
How about as often as I need to?

SAM
Need?

JOSH
He's right.

C.J.
Don't answer it.

LEO
What else?

SAM
Has the President known?

LEO
The President and I have a long history and a close personal friendship...

SAM
You didn't answer the question.

LEO
The President has known, as well as the FBI and the Secret Service.

C.J.
Did they raise any objection to a man with your problem in such a sensitive
position?

LEO
Yeah, they were concerned I'd sell state secrets to Bolivia for a quick...

JOSH
It's not a totally unreasonable question.

LEO
Yeah, I'm all set.

C.J.
Okay.

Leo goes to his desk. Sam, Josh and C.J. stand and get ready to leave.

SAM
Uh, Leo, I wrote a draft to the President's statement of support. I thought
you might
want to...

LEO
[surprised] What did you do?

SAM
I wrote a draft to the President's statement of support.

LEO
Who told you to do that?

SAM
The President's in no condition...

LEO
[yells] I know what conditions he's in. I'm asking who told you to write a
statement
of support?

JOSH
Toby told him last night to...

SAM
Nobody had to tell me. You're about to get attacked. It's what I do.

LEO
No, your job isn't to protect me, Sam. It's to protect the President.

SAM
Leo...

LEO
Do me a favor, Sam. Don't show initiative. Don't rush to my defense. I don't
want to
see you on Crossfire. I don't want to see you on Larry King. I don't want
to read your
name in Newsweek unless it's an advocacy of the President's agenda.
[calms down] I go down, I go down. I'm not taking anyone with me... Is that
clear?

SAM
Yes, sir.

LEO
I'm all set. Go back to work.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

Bartlet, now awake, sits up on his side of the bed still in his pajamas. Abbey,
all
dressed up, is seated beside him and has just finished taking her husband's
temperature.

ABBEY
Well, the good news is, your temperature's gone down.

BARTLET
Can I go to the office?

ABBEY
No.

BARTLET
Why not?

ABBEY
It hasn't gone down enough, and it's gonna go back up again.

BARTLET
Why?

ABBEY
'Cause you have the flu.

Abbey takes her stethoscope and puts the end on the President's back. She
listens.

BARTLET
Here's the thing though. I never really saw you study while you were in med
school.

ABBEY
Deep breath.

BARTLET
Do you even know what you're listening for right now? [inhales]

ABBEY
Do you know how many other people I could have married?

BARTLET
[exhales] How many?

ABBEY
Shhh.

BARTLET
I'm going to the office.

ABBEY
Okay.

BARTLET
Really?

ABBEY
Feel free.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet takes off his blanket and tries to stand up. Before he could, he
realizes he's
still dizzy and sits back down.

BARTLET
Uh-oh.

ABBEY
Anything else?

BARTLET
Alright. I think I'll stay here for a little bit.

ABBEY
Okay.

The President puts back his blanket.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Leo is waiting just outside the briefing room. Carol opens the door.

CAROL
Leo?

LEO
Mm-hmm?

CAROL
They're ready for you.

LEO
Thank you.

CAROL
You need anything?

LEO
No.

Leo goes into the PRESS BRIEFING ROOM. The reporters are on their
seats. Cameras
flash. Leo steps behind the podium.

LEO
Good morning.

REPORTERS
Good morning.

LEO
A story, in which many, if not most of you, are aware of already, will break
in wide
circulation by the end of the day. I'd like to take this opportunity to read
a brief
statement before I answer your questions.
[starts reading] In June of 1993, I voluntarily admitted myself to the
Sierra-Tucson
Rehabilitation Facility to treat an addiction to alcohol and Valium.
[looks up, cameras flash from everywhere]
I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.
[looks up again] I deeply regret the pain and trouble this has caused for
the people
in my life. I'd like to, at this point, clarify a few things...

DISSOLVE TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Donna and Josh are walking.

DONNA
Roger Tribby.

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
I don't know why you're picking the secretary of agriculture.

JOSH
Because the secretaries of defense, state and treasury are famous faces,
and we want
the camera to find them.

DONNA
So, if the Capitol Building blows up...

JOSH
Yes.

DONNA
The man my country will be looking to is the secretary of agriculture.

JOSH
It's my country too.

DONNA
Yeah, but you'll be dead.

JOSH
Which is why I really don't care that much.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Donna, I really don't anticipate the Capitol Building exploding.

DONNA
What percentage of things exploding have been anticipated?

JOSH
Now you're bringing me down.

DONNA
I would think so. [walks away]

JOSH
[sees Sam] Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

JOSH
I thought he did well.

SAM
Yeah, he did.

JOSH
I read the statement you wrote for the President--sensational, Sam. I'm
sorry no one's
gonna read it.

SAM
The President's gonna read it. He's reading it right now.

JOSH
Sam?

SAM
I don't care.

JOSH
Leo's gonna kill us!

SAM
I don't care. Do you?

JOSH
Nah.

We pan to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. Toby is having a meeting with RAYMOND BURNS
and two
other Congressmen about the State of the Union address.

BURNS
Toby, I'm concerned that the speech contains a number of positions that
democrats and
Congress aren't quite on board with yet.

TOBY
They're free to write they're own speech.

BURNS
I understand, but they are the ones who are gonna have to run against us a
year from now.

TOBY
What are your concerns?

CONGRESSMAN
We feel, even in this draft--

BURNS
And, you've made some progress.

CONGRESSMAN
Yes, but even in this draft, there's too much emphasis placed on the role
of federal
government.

TOBY
I've pared down...

BURNS
We know.

TOBY
This is an opportunity for a pep rally. This is an opportunity to trumpet
government.
Why do we want to pretend to be sorry for intruding?

CONGRESSMAN
Because that's what people want to hear.

TOBY
So I've been told.

BURNS
Toby?

TOBY
Why don't' you pick your section of the speech. Fight with me about it,
and I'll lose,
and then I can call in the next group.

BURNS
You understand--

TOBY
Pick a section. There's a line waiting outside. I've got 31 hours to-to
write this...

BURNS
We don't--

CONGRESSMAN
Federal funding for the arts.

TOBY
The N.E.A.? [sighs] Let us open our hymnals to page 22.

The Congressman smiles.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is reading a piece of paper. The television on his right broadcasts his
press
conference. He looks at himself for a brief moment. He turns the TV off with
a remote
control before Margaret walks in.

MARGARET
Leo? Mallory's here.

LEO
Okay.

MALLORY [OS]
[to Margaret] Thanks. [walks in] Dad?

LEO
Hey, Mal. [hugs her daughter]

MALLORY
Are you okay?

LEO
I'm fine.

MALLORY
You told me your press conference was gonna be this afternoon.

LEO
I told you that I didn't know...

MALLORY
I wanted to be there.

LEO
It's okay.

MALLORY
No, it's not. Mom and I should have been there.

LEO
Oh, yes, definitely a picture of me standing next to my estranged wife--

MALLORY
Dad?

LEO
Mallory?

MALLORY
I don't want to fight with you.

LEO
Okay... Anyway...

MALLORY
I saw a copy of the President's statement.

LEO
[surprised] What statement?

MALLORY
For the press, supporting you. It's-it's floating around.

LEO
It's floating around?

MALLORY
It's very moving, dad. He loves you so much.

LEO
Excuse me. [heads out]

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Sam talks to a staffer. Josh comes up from behind.

SAM
Pages one and two.

JOSH
Sam.

SAM
Yeah?

JOSH
Where are we at?

SAM
We're getting slapped around on the N.E.A.

JOSH
Oh, man! Why is he...?

They go into SAM'S OFFICE.

SAM
Josh.

JOSH
I mean N.E.A. is putting up a fight...

Leo walks in. He's angry.

LEO
You did it again.

JOSH
Leo...

LEO
[yells] You did it again!

JOSH
I understand you're being pissed off--

LEO
Has the President seen it?

JOSH
Yes, and he--

LEO
Who gave it to him?

JOSH
Leo?

LEO
Who gave it to him?

JOSH
I did.

SAM
I did.

LEO
What, you're giving me Abbott and Costello?

SAM
I did.

LEO
I told you...

SAM
They want to tear you down, plain and simple. They don't like you and this
is what
they do, and for us not to defend you? I disobeyed you. I apologize, but
that's the
way it is.

Behind Leo, Bonnie just got off the phone.

BONNIE
Leo?

LEO
Yeah?

BONNIE
The First Lady's in your office.

LEO
Thank you. [to Sam] This is not what I wanted. [walks away]

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Abbey is joking with Mallory.

ABBEY
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

MALLORY
Abbey?

ABBEY
You've got an itch for Sam Seaborn.

MALLORY
I do not have an itch.

ABBEY
A little itch.

MALLORY
Abbey? You...

ABBEY
Want a nickel worth of free advice?

MALLORY
Sure.

ABBEY
Don't go for the geniuses. They never want to sleep.

LEO
[walks in] Hey.

ABBEY
Oh, Leo, hi. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't take you away from something.

LEO
Oh, no, no, no. Mallory, would you mind...?

MALLORY
I do not have an itch!

LEO
[surprised] Mallory?!

MALLORY
I'm going.

ABBEY
[kisses Mallory] Bye sweetie.

MALLORY
[kisses Leo] Bye daddy.

Mallory leaves and closes the door. Abbey shifts to the couch.

ABBEY
You did good today.

LEO
Thank you.

ABBEY
Mallory was very proud of you.

LEO
Well...

ABBEY
Leo, I came by because I wanted to ask do you think there's a huge downside
to
postponing for a few days?

LEO
Did the fever go back up?

ABBEY
No, it's going down.

LEO
Abbey? What's going on?

ABBEY
Nothing. Uh, like I say--

LEO
What should I know that I don't know?

ABBEY
I just thought we should be on the safe side.

LEO
Why'd you cancel your trip?

ABBEY
Because he has the--

LEO
Because that President has a temperature. The President's not in nursery
school.

ABBEY
Look, if it's a problem to postpone--

LEO
It's not a problem to postpone. Of course, I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
the
President's health. What I'm saying...

ABBEY
Leo, please.

LEO
[sits] Hey, hey, hey. This is me. This has happened before. I see you trying
to
cover the panic. I see you prescribing medication. I think you're giving
him shots.
What does he have he can't tell people?

ABBEY
He has the flu.

LEO
Ugh! You would not have come back for the flu, Abbey.

ABBEY
He fainted. He was running a fever.

LEO
Abbey?

A pause. Almost in tears, Abbey decides to tell him the truth.

ABBEY
He has multiple sclerosis, Leo.

LEO
[shocked] Oh, Abbey.

ABBEY
A fever could be life threatening.

Abbey tries hard to fight back tears, but couldn't. A tear falls from her eye.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

The television is on. A soap opera playing.

WOMAN IN T.V.
Mrs. Crane, there are some things you mustn't say to Chief Bennett. He's
married to
someone else and so are you.

Bartlet is in bed eating breakfast. Charlie is seated on a chair.

BARTLET
I don't understand. Don't any of these characters have jobs?

CHARLIE
I don't know, Mr. President. I think one of them is a surgeon.

BARTLET
They seem to have a lot of free time in the middle of the day.

The phone rings. Charlie answers it.

CHARLIE
Hello?

BARTLET
And that woman's changed her clothes for quite a lot in one afternoon.

CHARLIE
[hangs up] Mr. President, Mr. McGarry's outside.

BARTLET
Yeah. Would you mind stepping out, Charlie?

CHARLIE
No sir. [leaves]

Bartlet turns the T.V. off. Charlie closes the door when Leo walks in. Leo
walks over
to the President.

BARTLET
Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed
about seven years
ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is
relapsing-remitting,
which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives
me injections
of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and
stress tend to
be two things that induces attacks.

LEO
Well, you're the President of the United States, you're delivering the State
of the Union
tomorrow night, India and Pakistan are pointing nuclear weapons at each other,
and you
have a 102-degree fever. So I guess we're out of the woods, hmm?

BARTLET
101.9.

LEO
Jed, of all the things you could've kept from me...

BARTLET
You haven't called me 'Jed' since I was elected.

LEO
[sits] Why didn't you tell me?

BARTLET
'Cause I wanted to be the President.

LEO
That wouldn't have stopped me from getting you here. And I could've been a
friend.

BARTLET
You've been a friend.

LEO
But when it was time to really...

BARTLET
I know.

LEO
When I was lying on my face in the motel parking lot, you were the one I
called.

BARTLET
When you stood up there today, I was so proud. I wanted to be with you.

LEO
Nah. Nah.

BARTLET
I tried to get up, but I fell back down again.

LEO
I know the feeling.

BARTLET
[fights back tears] I'm so sorry, Leo. I really am.

CHARLIE
[opens the door] Mr. President?

LEO
Don't worry about it.

BARTLET
Yeah, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Lord Marbury.

BARTLET
Yeah, give us a minute, would you please?

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Toby is still in his meeting.

BURNS
Now, the President's proposing in his speech that the budget by the N.E.A. be
increased
by fifty percent?

TOBY
The National Endowment amounts to less than 1/100th of one percent of the
total budget
for the federal government. It costs taxpayers 39 cents a year. The arts
budget for the
U.S. is equivalent to the arts budget of Sweden.

BURNS
That is such a big deal being made out of the performance arts of the
Mapplethorpe
photographs--

TOBY
You gay bashing, Raymond?

BURNS
Well, once again, all we'd like is for you to not mention the N.E.A.

CONGRESSMAN
Personally, I don't know what to say to people who argue that the N.E.A. is
there to
support art that nobody wants to pay for in the first place. I don't know
what to tell
people when they say Rogers and Hart didn't need the N.E.A. to write Oklahoma,
and Arthur
Murray didn't need the N.E.A. to write Death of a Salesman.

TOBY
I'd start by telling them that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote Oklahoma,
and Arthur Murray
taught ballroom dance, and Arthur Miller did need the N.E.A. to write Death
of a Salesman,
but it wasn't called the N.E.A. back then. It was called W.P.A. and it was
Roosevelt's...
[long pause] It was Roosevelt's...

BURNS
Toby?

TOBY
Yeah?

BURNS
You stopped talking in the middle of a...?

TOBY
Thank you everybody. This meeting is over.

Toby leaves. The congressmen looked surprised.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY
Bartlet and Leo are settled on the couch. Lord Marbury is across them.

MARBURY
You know, there are some marvelous flu remedies known in the certain remote
parts of
the subcontinent. Licorice root, for instance, combined with bamboo sap and
a strong
shot of whiskey. Ginger root, also, mixed with, uh, citrus peel.

BARTLET
And a strong shot of whiskey?

MARBURY
Yes, of course. In fact, you can throw out the ginger root and citrus peel,
and still
be well in your way.

BARTLET
What have you got for me, John?

MARBURY
Well, um, after speaking at length this past week with your secretaries of
state and
defense, as well as your joint chiefs and various embassy officials, I
believe this.
Buy them off.

BARTLET
Buy them?

MARBURY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How?

MARBURY
Mr. President, for several centuries, my kingdom has ruled India with a
stick and carrot.
When we had a particular problem with someone, one solution we would try is
to make him
a maharaja. That's kind of a regional king. We would pay him off with an
annual tribute,
and in return, he would be loyal to the crown.

LEO
Lord Marbury, under our Constitution, our President is not empowered to
create maharajas.

MARBURY
Yes. Thank you for clearing that up, Leo. Having been educated at Cambridge
and the
Sorbonne, I am, as you know, exceedingly stupid.

BARTLET
John, please.

MARBURY
You've been paying the world off since the industrial age. Foreign aid,
during the Cold
War was you paying dictators to be on your side. To this very day, you pay
Korea not to
develop nuclear weapons.

BARTLET
What does India want?

MARBURY
A computer industry, and for that, they require an infrastructure, and that
is what you
can give them.

LEO
Why?

MARBURY
It's the price you pay.

LEO
For avoiding a war halfway around the world?

MARBURY
For being rich, free and alive all at the same time, and for the criminally
negligent
behavior of your Congress in not checking the proliferation of nuclear
devices.

BARTLET
Your friend, the prime minister?

MARBURY
Rikki.

BARTLET
He's gonna go for this?

MARBURY
If it's handled properly.

BARTLET
All right, you tell the ambassador we'll discuss this in three months. In
three months,
John. I don't want this to be like quid pro quo.

MARBURY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
That's the carrot. Leo, what's the stick?

LEO
In the next 24 hours, we want to see recon photos of Indian divisions
retreating. If we
don't, we're gonna seize Indian assets and so will our NATO allies, and
G-7's gonna call
in its loans.

BARTLET
They put command-control in the field, John, and we're gonna get physical. You
make damn
sure they know that.

MARBURY
Well, then, uh, I have my instructions.

The three of them stand.

BARTLET
Talk to the ambassador. I want Fitzwallace to have photos in 24 hours.

MARBURY
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [leaves]

CHARLIE
[opens the door] Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yes, Charlie?

CHARLIE
Toby's here.

BARTLET
Toby, come in please.

LEO
I'm gonna go back to the office.

BARTLET
Let's hope.

TOBY
[enters] Leo.

LEO
Hey, Toby. [leaves]

TOBY
How you feeling, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Much better. Thank you.

TOBY
Good.

BARTLET
You know, I was watching a television program before with a sort of a roving
moderator
who spoke to a seated panel of young women who are having some sort of
problems with
their boyfriends. Apparently, because the boyfriends have all slept with
the girlfriend's
mothers. Then they brought all the boyfriends out and they fought right
there on television.
Toby, tell me, these people don't vote, do they?

TOBY
I wouldn't think so. No sir.

JOSH
[pokes his head in] Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
What do you need, Josh?

TOBY
I asked Josh to join me here, sir.

BARTLET
[sits] What's on your mind?

TOBY
The era of big government is over.

BARTLET
You want to cut the line?

TOBY
I want to change the sentiment. We're running away from ourselves, and I
know we can score
points that way. I was the principle architect in that campaign strategy,
right along with
you, Josh. But we're here now. Tomorrow night, we do an immense thing. We
have to say what
we feel. That government, no matter what its failures are in the past,
and in times to come,
for that matter, the government can be a place where people come together
and where no one
gets left behind. No one... gets left behind, an instrument of... good.
[pause] I have no trouble understanding why the line tested well, Josh,
but I don't think
that means we should say it. I think that means we should... change it.

BARTLET
I think so, too. [beat] What do you think, Josh?

JOSH
I'd make it a point never to disagree with Toby when he's right,
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Then you and Sam get your people together and get to work.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Toby and Josh leave.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
WEDNESDAY NIGHT
Everyone is waiting for the State of the Union address. Josh, Sam, and
C.J. are having
a conversation.

JOSH
[sing-song] You're jealous 'cause Danny was flirting with Mandy.

C.J.
I didn't say that. When did I say that?

JOSH
I read between the lines.

C.J.
There are no lines.

SAM
You know, C.J., it can be pretty confusing sometimes. I mean I'm at this
place with
Mallory, where I don't know if she likes me. I don't know if she doesn't
like me.
I don't know if she's indifferent altogether. I just wish she'd take the
bull by the
horns and get past it so we can move on.

Across the room, Mallory finds Sam.

MALLORY
Sam! Did you write this statement defending my father?

SAM
Uh, yes.

Mallory walks over to Sam and kisses him. She pulls back then kisses him
again, this time
longer than the first. Josh and C.J. just stare at them. Mallory walks away
after the kiss.

SAM
Well, now I'm even more confused.

JOSH
Yes.

SAM
Though, I gotta say, I'm enjoying being a writer.

C.J. looks around the room. She sees Carol.

C.J.
Carol, is Danny Concannon in the Press Room?

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J.
Would you have him come to my office, please?

C.J. smiles as CAROL walks away.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Abbey is going over the speech. Bartlet goes over to his wife and watches
as she buttons
his sleeve.

ABBEY
I want to take your temperature one last time.

BARTLET
Abbey...?

ABBEY
I want to take your temperature.

BARTLET
You've taken it 14 times in the last three hours. You're not taking it again.

ABBEY
Mmm... Fine.

BARTLET
At least not with a thermometer.

ABBEY
Oh, Jed.

BARTLET
I'm saying if you want to take it recreationally...

ABBEY
Oh, there's something wrong with you, you know that?

BARTLET
Yes, I do.

ABBEY
Why is 'hallowed' spelled with a pound sign in the middle?

BARTLET
I stopped asking those questions.

Bartlet takes off his wife's glasses and kisses her.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Danny is playing with Gail while waiting for C.J. Someone knocks at the door.

DANNY
Yes?

C.J. [OS]
It's C.J.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J. [OS]
Can I come in?

DANNY
C.J, this is your office.

C.J. [OS]
Right. [opens the door and comes in] Hello.

DANNY
Hello.

C.J.
So... you have asked me out many times. I have said no.

DANNY
You said yes once.

C.J.
That was a business dinner.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
Nonetheless, I do seem to have a preoccupation, um, sort of girlish, I suppose,
thing,
which, um... and please don't be in any way mislead by anything... in fact,
let me put
it this way...

DANNY
C.J., I'm gonna write about the speech tonight. My paper's gonna want to,
you know,
see it. Is there any way we can move this along?

C.J.
I thought what I'd do is kiss you, you know, on the mouth, then I'd just
get past it...
I'd just get past it, and I'll be able to give my work the kind of
concentration it
really deserves.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
How's right here?

DANNY
That's fine.

C.J.
Be careful of the fish.

DANNY
Sure

C.J.
No, I'm saying cause if you rock against the...

Danny grabs C.J. and kisses her.

DANNY
How's that?

C.J.
Oh, good.

DANNY
Past it?

C.J.
Yeah.

DANNY
Good.

C.J.
Okay, I got to go now. [takes Gail with her and heads out]

DANNY
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

DANNY
Taking that fish with you?

C.J.
No.

She puts the fishbowl back on the table and heads out. She bumps into the
door.

DANNY
Walked into that door there.

C.J.
Yes.

C.J. opens the door, walks out. She flashes a very big smile.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - NIGHT
Abbey and Lord Marbury are among the many people in the room. They go to
the door.

MARBURY
Uh, see, you're too fixed on western medicine. Bamboo sap, gambeer twig...

ABBEY
And a shot of whiskey.

MARBURY
And a shot of whiskey in the old sense.

Abbey laughs. They see Bartlet and Leo walking in. They all stand by the door.

ABBEY
Hello.

BARTLET
Good evening.

MARBURY
Good evening, Mr. President.

Bartlet gives him several photographs.

MARBURY
[goes over the pictures] Uh, well now, if I'm not mistaken, these are photos
of Indian
troops retreating, and so is that, and so is... this.

BARTLET
Thank you, John.

MARBURY
Well, I'm on a plane to go see Rikki in an hour... still many things to
settle.

BARTLET
Godspeed, your Lordship.

MARBURY
Thank you sir.

They shake hands.

MARBURY
Abigail! [kisses Abbey on the cheek]

LEO
Good luck, John.

MARBURY
Good luck to you too, Leo.

Leo shakes hands with Marbury.

MARBURY
I am off! [walks away]

Bartlet, Abbey, and Leo step inside THE MURAL ROOM.

BARTLET
Friends, let me have your attention please. A lot of time, energy, passion,
wit, skill,
and talent went into drafting this, and while you might not know it from my
delivery
later, this is an extraordinary speech. And I say thee yea! Toby Ziegler,
and I say
thee yea! Sam Seaborn!

Everyone in the room clap their hands for the President's
speechwriters. Charlie comes
in and informs the President.

CHARLIE
Sir, the motorcade's ready and the agriculture secretary is in the Oval
Office.

Bartlet nods. Everyone is still clapping for Toby and Sam.

CUT TO: INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Charlie opens the door from outside. Bartlet walks in. The secretary of
agriculture,
ROGER TRIBBY, is standing in the middle of the room.

BARTLET
Roger.

TRIBBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Roger, I'm sorry you drew the short straw on this. We'll miss you tonight. Next
year,
it'll be the surgeon general, I promise. Meanwhile, you can watch TV at my
study.

TRIBBY
Thank you, sir. [beat] Um, I brought you a gift. [offers him a book]

BARTLET
Oh, thank you.

TRIBBY
I know of your love of all things ancient, and I came across this.

BARTLET
What is it?

TRIBBY
Someone took the time to translate the Constitution into Latin. I think it
was a high
school project, actually, and uh, it got published.

BARTLET
This is magnificent.

TRIBBY
I highlighted what I thought was an appropriate passage from the executive
power section.
Can you translate?

BARTLET
[reads] 'He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information on
the state of
the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall
judge necessary
and expedient.'

TRIBBY
Sounds right up your alley, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you, Roger.

TRIBBY
Knock 'em dead, sir.

Bartlet heads to the door. He stops as he remembers something.

BARTLET
Oh, Roger, if anything happened, you know what to do, right?

TRIBBY
I honestly hadn't thought about it sir.

BARTLET
First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint
joint
chiefs. Appoint chairman. Take them to Defcon 4. Have the governor send
emergency
delegates to Washington. The assistant attorney general is gonna be the
acting A.G.
If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells
you.

LEO'S OFFICE. As Bartlet tells Tribby the procedure, we see Leo walk into
his office
to get his coat. The door to the Oval Office is open so he can hear the
President
and Tribby, but couldn't see them.

BARTLET
You have a best friend?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Is he smarter than you?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Would you trust him with your life?

ROGER
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
That's your chief of staff.

Leo, obvioiusly touched, stops for a minute and walks away.

Back in THE OVAL OFFICE, Charlie walks in. Bartlet continues to speak.

BARTLET
Oh, in the residence, in the second floor, the bathroom at the end of the
hall.
You have to jiggle the handle a little.

CHARLIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
I got to go. [beat] You'll do fine. People have phenomenal capacity.

ROGER
Yes, sir.

Bartlet holds his book and puts his fist against his chest close to the
heart. Tribby
stands watch as the President and Charlie leave. After they've gone, Tribby
is standing
in front of the Presidential seal and looks around the Oval Office in awe.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
