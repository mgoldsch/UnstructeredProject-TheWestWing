TEASER

FADE IN: INT. - SENATE HEARING ROOM - DAY
      82 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY

Margaret is testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

CHAIRMAN
Good morning. This is an inquiry by the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence. This is the 14th closed hearing by this committee as
we conduct our joint inquiry into the disclosure of classified, national
security information to the press. Will the witness please stand and raise
your right hand to take the oath?

Margaret stands.

CHAIRMAN
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony that you give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

MARGARET
I do.

CHAIRMAN
Senator Dresden, you may proceed.

She sits.

SENATOR DRESDEN
Ms. Hooper, good morning. Thank you for joining us. You are White House
Chief of Staff Claudia Jean Cregg's Executive assistant; is that correct?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
And you are responsible for connecting all calls from both outside and inside
the White House to the Chief of Staff through your office line?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
I assume you are aware of the White House archiving system known as ARMS?

MARGARET
I am.

Dresden begins passing her several folders and documents.

DRESDEN
This committee has subpoenaed copies of the electronic material that passed
through the office of Chief of Staff between December 30 and July 14 of this
year. In total, the search included 19 segments of the ARMS database. Separate
subpoenas were served to include the use of e-mails from both interoffice
hard drives to the individual servers of Blackberry and various other devices
of an electronic nature. Did you need a glass of water?

MARGARET
I'm fine.

DRESDEN
Can we get her a glass of water, please?

AIDE
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
You're aware of an article in The New York Times on July 14 of this year,
claiming the existence of a top secret military space shuttle?

MARGARET
Yes, sir, I am.

DRESDEN
And you're aware the reporter responsible for the article's contents is
Greg Brock, who has been jailed for refusing to reveal his source of the
information?

The aide brings her some water.

MARGARET
Yes.

DRESDEN
Am I correct in noting that Mr. Brock appears on Ms. Cregg's interoffice
phone log between 2 and 14 times a week in the six months before June 30? Does
that sound accurate?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
On June 27, you received a call on your main office line from Mr. Brock's
cell phone at 7:27 am. Is that correct?

She looks through one of the files in front of her.

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
What can you tell us about the nature of that call?

MARGARET
I wasn't in the room with Ms. Cregg at the time of call so I can't say what
she and Mr. Brock spoke about.

DRESDEN
You can't say?

MARGARET
I mean, I don't know.

DRESDEN
Well, Mr. Brock called again at 1:29, and then again at 2:20 that same
afternoon. On the first call, you then patched it through to Ms. Cregg on
her Blackberry. Is that correct?

MARGARET
That's correct.

DRESDEN
Am I correct in noting that the calls that come through your phone can be
monitored by the person manning your phone after they've been connected to
their designated line? I would remind you that you're under oath.

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
So you were capable of monitoring Ms. Cregg's phone calls, private and
otherwise?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
So let me start by asking you, did you ever monitor any phone conversations
between Ms. Cregg and Mr. Brock?

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. - CAMPAIGN SITE - DAY
      UNNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
      FRIDAY

Santos is giving a stump speech. The crowd is cheering. Leo is among those
seated on stage.

SANTOS
How long can we generate a third of this world's economic output if a third
of our students don't even meet the most basic reading levels. How long can
we stay number one in high-tech jobs if we are declining in the percentage
of bachelor's degrees.

Josh and Lou are off to the side and they are talking. Annabeth is on
the phone.

LOU
So, what are you saying?

JOSH
They couldn't get Creationism into classrooms because it violates the
separation of church and state.

LOU
They're going to run into the same roadblock with Intelligent Design.

JOSH
The local Board of Education just held hearings on why Intelligent Design
should be taught in classrooms alongside evolution, so local reporters are
going to want to talk about it.

LOU
So, the state Board of Education has a problem with the Constitution?

JOSH
The majority of the Board was taken over by Evangelical Christians in the
last election.

ANNABETH
Vinick's on his way to Atlanta. He's still hammering us on border issues.

Ned walks up and hands out some papers.

NED
It looks like the togetherness tour is working.

ANNABETH
Hmm. The Washington Post calls the Santos/McGarry road-show an effective
blend of energy and experience.

JOSH
The L.A. Times said Leo actually looked lifelike.

ANNABETH
The Post Dispatch calls our "Education Week" "Boring Week."

SANTOS
When we are talking about education, we're talking about our most precious
resource: our children. Ladies and gentlemen, we must find better ways...

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Toby and Charlie are walking.

TOBY
Good morning.

CHARLIE
You owe me money.

TOBY
I'm working.

CHARLIE
I'm just saying...

TOBY
We're talking about a guy with a career 2.37 ERA.

CHARLIE
I am.

TOBY
He had a 0.98 ERA going into the break; went 21 straight without blowing
one save.

CHARLIE
And last night's game makes it an even 50 bucks.

TOBY
I'm working.

CHARLIE
So am I. C.J. was up all night.

TOBY
Any word from Margaret?

CHARLIE
She's up on the Hill testifying; she'll be back in about an hour.

TOBY
When do you go up?

CHARLIE
Tomorrow. You?

TOBY
Tuesday.

C.J. walks up.

C.J.
Hi. What are you guys talking about?

Toby and Charlie answer simultaneously.

TOBY
Nothing.

CHARLIE
Baseball.

C.J.
Get that coffee away from me.

TOBY
You were here all night again?

C.J.
Omnibus intellectual property bill; limited infringement benefits for good
faith uses; third-party participation for patent exemptions; ain't we got fun?

TOBY
You're talking very fast.

C.J.
Don't you owe Charlie money?

TOBY
We're talking about a guy with a career 2.37 ERA.

C.J.
Shoo.

TOBY
Shooing.

C.J.
I need less coffee and more sleep. What's up?


CHARLIE
They were out of soy. I got the caramel thing with double whip.

C.J.
You know what I'm talking about.

CHARLIE
Toby got served yesterday.

C.J.
How many people around here have subpoenas?

CHARLIE
Lots.

C.J.
Lots.

CHARLIE
We've got trouble.

C.J.
Trouble with a capital "T," and that rhymes with "P," and that stands for pool.

CHARLIE
You need to go home and get some rest.

C.J.
I just need a little power nap.

CHARLIE
How about half an hour; no people, no calls?

C.J.
Oh, jeez. I forgot to call Leo.

CHARLIE
About what?

C.J.
Don't ask.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAMPAIGN - DAY

Santos is still speaking.

SANTOS
Our economy is changing. We are in an information revolution and nearly 60%
of companies say that they face...

We pan over to the side of the stage where Josh, Lou, Annabeth, and Ned
are talking.

LOU
When are we going to DC?

ANNABETH
Two hours.

Josh notices Leo looking at his watch.

JOSH
He's doing it again.

ANNABETH
I'm on it.

SANTOS
Should we just throw up our hands and do nothing?

CROWD
No!

SANTOS
I can't hear you!

CROWD
No!

SANTOS
Don't we want those jobs here, in America?

CROWD
Yes!

SANTOS
Do we really want them to go to India and China where they have the skills
at a quarter of the cost?

CROWD
No!

SANTOS
What?!

CROWD
No!

SANTOS
Let this be a call to action to all of us today so that we can make sure that
all students, all teachers, all schools have the support that they need to
meet the highest possible standards for our children's brightest possible
future. Thank you all for coming today.

The crowd begins cheering and applauding. Leo is among the first to stand
on the platform and applaud.

JOSH
Whoo!

Santos walks off stage and Josh starts talking to him.

JOSH
Vinick's on his way to Atlanta for a lunch with the Chamber of Commerce.

SANTOS
Is he still hammering me on border issues?

LOU
Jack-hammering.

JOSH
Either way, it's Education Week. We stay on message.

SANTOS
I'm getting a lot of questions on Intelligent Design.

JOSH
That's a local issue. We stay on message, we stay in control.

Santos walks off. We see Annabeth walk over to Leo.

ANNABETH
Give me your watch.

LEO
I wasn't...

ANNABETH
People don't think you like the speech.

LEO
I like the speech, but I'm getting it five times a day.

ANNABETH
We didn't put you up here for your own entertainment, Leo.

LEO
Is someone on the phone?

ANNABETH
C.J.

LEO
Give me the phone.

ANNABETH
Give me the watch.

LEO
Oh, for the love of...

ANNABETH
Give me the watch.

He gives her the watch.

LEO
You're not a tall person.

ANNABETH
And I think you're fabulous.

She gives him the phone.

LEO
Help me, God, please.

C.J. is on speakerphone with Leo.

C.J.
How's Education Week going?

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Charlie comes in.

C.J.
Sounds like a real hoot. Listen, I got a call from the Vinick campaign.

LEO
About?

C.J.
Apparently he had an analyst go off on a situation in Kazakhstan in his
daily CIA briefing.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAMPAIGN - CONTINUOUS

Do we have a situation in Kazakhstan?

Vinick wants a new briefer.

C.J.
Yeah.

C.J.'s cell phone starts ringing. Charlie comes in.

CHARLIE
C.J., I have Kate Harper.

C.J.
What line?

Kate comes in and grabs the remote off of C.J.'s desk.

KATE
We're getting fragmented reports, but they're confirming a suicide bombing.

She turns the TV on to a report about a suicide bombing.

REPORTER [on TV]
Reports are still not clear on how close the bomber was to the Chairman,
but we can confirm that Palestinian Leader Farad has been the victim of a
suicide bombing.

LEO [VO]
C.J., you there?


C.J.

Leo.



LEO [VO]
Yeah?

REPORTER [on TV]
... no word yet on whether Farad is dead or alive.

C.J.
Find a television.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Bartlet comes in and the people around the table come to attention.

BARTLET
Go ahead. Please.

They sit as Kate begins.

KATE
At 9:33 Jerusalem time, Palestinian Chairman Farad was on his way back from
speaking at a University in the West Bank when a vehicle charged his motorcade
and exploded. Several students were killed and Farad was injured. He's been
rushed to Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives. So far, we're
unclear on the extent of his injuries, but we have confirmed that most of
his security detail was killed.

BARTLET
Has anyone claimed responsibility?

KATE
Not yet.

BARTLET
Do we have Commander Perkins?

C.J.
On speaker.

BARTLET
Warren, have we heard from the Israelis?

COMMANDER PERKINS
Not yet, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Who sent the bomber?

KATE
It's too soon to tell.

HUTCHINSON
Smart money is on Hamas or Islamic Jihad.

KATE
Our real concern is whether this is part of a larger scheme, backed by Syria
or Iran.

SLATTERY
Iran and Syria are interested in the status quo.

KATE
They don't want our peacekeeping mission to succeed. They need the Palestinian
problem to keep their own people interested in the West.

C.J.
Who's in charge with Farad injured?

KATE
The Speaker of the Palestinian House of Representatives assumes the
presidency. The constitution calls for an election in 60 days to fill the post.

BARTLET
Prime Minister Mukarat would win any popular election.

C.J.
Unless Hamas wants to exploit the situation.

HUTCHINSON
We don't want fighting to break out between Hamas and the Palestinian
security forces.

SLATTERY
That could be a prelude to civil war.

C.J.
With our peacekeepers caught in the crossfire.

Kate has gone to a phone on the wall. She hangs it up and comes back to
the table.

KATE
Chairman Farad died five minutes ago.

Bartlet stands and everyone else does too.

BARTLET
We need to do everything in our power to help the Palestinians hold this
together.

He heads out of the room. He gets to the door that would lead out into the
basement but he turns, as if to head back into the Sit Room. Before getting
there, he turns again and sits down in one of the chairs. Almost immediately
after sitting, he gets up and walks out. He hits his fist on the door as
he does.

CUT TO: EXT. - BUILDING - DAY

Santos is walking up to prepare for the next event. Josh comes to speak to
him. Ned and Lou are with Santos.

JOSH
The press is waiting. Here's a draft of your Farad speech.

SANTOS
I know what I'm going to say, Josh. What do we know?

LEO
Farad's dead. Suicide bombing.

SANTOS
Mukarat?

LEO
The President's trying to rally support.

SANTOS
And the Israelis?

LEO
Zahavy will tighten security, close their checkpoints...

SANTOS
If the Israelis reenter those territories...

JOSH
There'll be a special briefing for both of you in about an hour.

SANTOS
Vinick's responding?

JOSH
In a couple of minutes.

LOU
This funeral's going to blow us out of the water.

JOSH
This wasn't exactly a popular guy.

SANTOS
Bartlet has to make this funeral a major event if he wants to hold the peace.

LOU
We've got about two or three days until the campaign shuts down.

NED
Maybe we should shut down tomorrow.

LOU
Are you out of your mind?

NED
Out of respect.

LOU
This is a national campaign, Ted.

NED
My name is...

LOU
Vinick's not going to take two minutes out of...

JOSH
Guys, come on.

SANTOS
I want to call the President; offer my condolences. I know that he and Farad
we're close.

LEO
We'll make sure we have time for that after your statement to the press.

JOSH
This is a pit stop; no stray questions.

SANTOS
Got it.

NED
Can you take a call from headquarters?

LOU
Sure. I'll catch up.

JOSH
His name is Ned.

LOU
What?

JOSH
Ted. His name's actually Ned.

LOU
I don't like head. Hello.

CUT TO: EXT. - WALKWAY - DAY

The press is lined up and waiting to hear from Santos.

REPORTER #1
Congressman, can you respond to Chairman Farad's death?

SANTOS
"Those souls are great who, dying, gave a gift of greater life to man. Death
stands abashed before the brave. They own a life death cannot ban." My
thoughts are with Chairman Farad's family and to all who share the dream of
peace throughout the world.

REPORTER #2
Congressman, will you be attending the funeral?

SANTOS
We've only just received the news.

REPORTER #3
Congressman, you're aware that this state's Board of Education is questioning
the teaching of evolution?

SANTOS
That's a state matter and I don't think this is the right time. Thank you.

He turns to leave.

REPORTER #3
Congressman, can you tell us if you believe in Intelligent Design.

SANTOS
I believe in God, and I like to think he's intelligent.

REPORTER #2
Does that mean you think it should be taught in schools, Congressman?

He leaves.

REPORTER #2
Does that mean you don't believe in evolution? Josh, can we get a follow-up
question, please?

Josh and Lou look worried at what Santos has just said.

ADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. - BUILDING - DAY

Josh, Leo, and Lou, Annabeth, and Ned are walking back from the press event.

JOSH
It was a gaffe.

LOU
It was not.

JOSH
It was worse than that; it was a God Gaffe.

LEO
Can we please not call it that?

JOSH
He said he believed in Intelligent Design.

LOU
That's not what he said.

JOSH
Well, he didn't say he didn't.

LOU
He didn't say he did.

JOSH
It's Creationism with a Groucho mask.

LOU
It isn't. It deviates enough from the bible to say that the Earth is, indeed,
over six thousand years.

JOSH
Zippity-do-dah.

LOU
And it doesn't say that God created everything, but perhaps an intelligent
designer was behind it.

JOSH
When asked if he believes in Intelligent Design he says, "I believe in
God." That sounds like a yes. It sounds like he wants the bible taught in
biology class, which, of course...

LOU
He doesn't.

JOSH
He got pulled off message, which means that we are off message, which means
that we're out of control.

LOU
You're right.

JOSH
Thank you. We have issue a clarifying statement.

Ronna walks up.

RONNA
Josh, the phones are ringing off the hook at headquarters.

LEO
How many Congressional?

RONNA
15. Half of our base is on the list; ACLU, NARAL, teacher's unions...

LOU
Hey, hey, hey. Were there any positive phone calls?

RONNA
A couple, but most of them think that he's either pandering or worse.

JOSH
Or that he believes in Intelligent Design.

LEO
Does anybody have the time?

Josh and Ned both look at their watches.

JOSH
It's, uh, 10:20.

ANNABETH
Leo, we've got a plane to catch. Goodbye, everybody.

LEO
The woman stole my watch. You got a minute?

They walk off to the side to talk.

LEO
I got served. They want me to appear on Monday.

JOSH
Before Congress?

LEO
Yeah.

ANNABETH
Leo.

LEO
I'll call you from the plane.

Josh looks worried as Leo walks off.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Kate and C.J. are walking.

KATE
What time is Prime Minister Zahavy calling?

C.J.
The President's waiting in the Oval now.

Charlie is in the hall and speaks to her as she passes him.

CHARLIE
Vinick.

C.J.
Right. I got a call from the Vinick campaign about a CIA analyst going
bonkers in his daily briefing. He wouldn't shut up about Uzbekistan.

KATE
Uzbekistan?

C.J.
Or was it Kazakhstan? One of the Stan's.

KATE
Did he remember the agents name?

C.J.
No.

KATE
I'll get into it.

C.J.
Thanks.

Kate's beeper starts going off.

C.J.
Are you okay?

KATE
They're calling me.

C.J. walks into her office and Kate walks away. Toby comes into the office.

TOBY
How are you doing?

C.J.
I'm on my last drop of adrenaline. How about you?

Charlie walks in.

CHARLIE
That guy called again.

C.J.
Margaret often gives me a name.

TOBY
Margaret's not back yet?

CHARLIE
A Mr. Frost, Charles Frost.

C.J.
I don't know him.

Charlie leaves.

TOBY
Have you heard about Santos and how smart God is?

C.J.
Sounds like "Education Week" is evolving into "Religion Week."

TOBY
I'm briefing in ten minutes. Has the President spoken to Zahavy?

C.J.
Any minute. We're in the Oval.

TOBY
Hey, I got subpoenaed.

C.J.
Congratulations.

TOBY
You?

C.J.
Nope. Last one to get a subpoena is a rotten egg.

TOBY
Last one to get a subpoena is the focus of the investigation. Do you have
a lawyer?

C.J.
No, I do not.

TOBY
Get one.

C.J.
I don't need a lawyer if I haven't done anything wrong.

CHARLIE
The President's on with Zahavy.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is on the phone with Prime Minister Zahavy.

BARTLET
I understand, Eli. I feel exactly the same way.

C.J. and Toby come in from C.J.'s office.

BARTLET
I'm sure we all hope for that. ... Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

He hangs up.

C.J.
Anything?

BARTLET
No. He's nervous.

C.J.
Will Prime Minister Zahavy be attending the funeral?

BARTLET
He wouldn't commit. Dan.

C.J.
Palestinians are protesting, in Ramallah, in Bethlehem, claiming Israeli
extremists were behind this.

TOBY
That's Hamas.

C.J.
Did Zahavy confirm the closing of his checkpoints?

BARTLET
Yes. And he agreed that he would like to see Mukarat win the election.

C.J.
If the Israelis reenter the territories...

TOBY
Mukarat goes down.

C.J.
You think we can hold everything together for 60 days?

BARTLET
If we can keep Mukarat alive for three, it'll be a miracle. Toby.

TOBY
First draft only, sir.

Kate walks in.

KATE
Sir, we have an update on the bomber. His name is Asim bin Ahmed. He was a
23-year-old student at Al Quds University in Hebron.

BARTLET
A student?


KATE
He had friends on the Jihad Mosque soccer team.

C.J.
A jihad soccer team?

KATE
Several members of the team have carried out suicide bombings. Though the
bomber had no formal ties to Hamas, his classmates say he spent hours at
the mosque praying and studying.

She hands him a folder.

KATE
Sir, our satellites are showing Israeli tank movement.

BARTLET
We need to announce our plans to attend the funeral.

C.J.
Sir?

BARTLET
We'll round up Zahavy, Prime Minister Grady, President D'Astier, and
Chancellor Earhart.

C.J.
Have they said they're coming?

BARTLET
Not yet.

KATE
The Palestinians want to have the funeral in Israeli-controlled Jerusalem
on the Dome of the Rock.

BARTLET
Jerusalem's beautiful this time of year.

C.J.
No one is going to be able to guarantee your security. Secret Service is
going to go crazy.

KATE
Only world leaders with a death wish would go to this funeral.

BARTLET
Fine, then we'll send Congress.

TOBY
You should go, sir. The Palestinians need to see you there. They need to see
how much you respected Farad, how committed you still are to the peace process.

BARTLET
I am going to attend this funeral and I want the leaders of the world to
attend with me.

Debbie walks in.

BARTLET
Let's get the leaders of Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt on the phone.

DEBBIE
It's almost 1:00 am in Cairo, sir.

BARTLET
Good. Let's wake some people up. Thank you everyone.

They thank him and begin to leave.

BARTLET
Commander.

Kate turns.

BARTLET
We're going to hold this peace together.

KATE
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAMPAIGN - DAY

Santos is getting out of the Suburban to go to a meeting of some sort. He
gets out to a booing crowd. Many people in the crowd are waving signs. Josh
gets out on the other side. Ned and he talk.

NED
The Governor's waiting inside. He wants to use his photographers.

JOSH
Tell him we're using ours. And make sure there's no press sneaking into the
parent-teacher round table.

NED
They'll be waiting outside.

He runs off. Josh starts talking to Lou.

JOSH
After the round table we're going to have to put something out clarifying
the Congressman's statement on Intelligent Design.

LOU
That says what, he thinks God's a moron?

JOSH
He's running for President, not preacher-in-chief.

LOU
He's not going to use Medicaid for communion wafers. He said he believes in
God, as did Abe Lincoln and George Washington.

JOSH
We can't get sucked into these local issues.

LOU
Yes, except Republicans have nominated a pro-choice and, by all accounts,
anti-God candidate in history. For the first time, we have a chance to
reach into their base and win back religious voters, to tell a swath of the
heartland that maybe, just maybe, we have a nominee who's not hostile to
their cultural values.

Santos walks up.

SANTOS
It looks like we got their attention.

JOSH
Which is why you're going to... what?

SANTOS
Stay on message.

JOSH
If someone asks you a question on Intelligent Design, you... what?

SANTOS
Answer it.

Josh and Lou answer simultaneously.

JOSH
No.

LOU
Yes.

SANTOS
Okay.

JOSH
ACLU and the Anti-Defamation League have called for clarification on your
God Gaffe.

SANTOS
My what?

JOSH
The Center for American Innovation and the Advancement of the American Way
are basically going bananas.

LOU
So don't let anybody bait you into using any kind of...

She gestures with her hand, looking for the appropriate word.

JOSH
Words.

SANTOS
Words?

JOSH
Yeah, words like...

LOU
Evolution.

JOSH
Genesis.

LOU
Monkey trial.

JOSH
Creationism.

LOU
School.

JOSH
Prayer.

LOU
Church.

JOSH
State.

SANTOS
Amen.

CHARLIE
She said they had more questions for her after lunch. You want some coffee?

C.J.
I'm taking a nap.

CHARLIE
Okay.

C.J.
I just need half an hour.

CHARLIE
You've got it.

C.J.
Did he say what he wanted?

CHARLIE
He said he needed to talk today.

She shuts the blinds.

C.J.
Try to find out who he is.

CHARLIE
No visitors, no calls?

C.J.
I just need a half an hour.

CHARLIE
Power nap?

C.J.
Yes.

CHARLIE
Sweet dreams.

He leaves the office.

C.J.
Charlie.

He turns around.

C.J.
Close the door.

CHARLIE
Right.

He shuts the door. C.J. lays down on her couch to try to get some sleep. As
she gets situated, Toby knocks and comes in the hallway door.

TOBY
You busy?

C.J.
Yes.

TOBY
You alone?

C.J.
I'm reading.

TOBY
I guess it's time for some reading glasses.

C.J.
What do you want?

TOBY
This meeting with Haffley on this education bill...

C.J.
Get Charlie to help you.

TOBY
Haffley's going to push us on private providers and he'll want the straight
A provisions to nullify the school-based provisions of Title I.

C.J.
It's legislative back-and-forth.

TOBY
And I want you to reconsider getting a lawyer.

She turns over to where she can look at him.

C.J.
Toby.

TOBY
Greg Brock...

C.J.
... is in jail.

She sits up.

C.J.
Charlie!

TOBY
Margaret's not back yet?

C.J.
Can't you see that I'm losing my mind?

Charlie comes in from Margaret's office.

C.J.
And if I can't sleep, I need at least ten minutes of quiet time to myself.

She gets up and puts her jacket on.

C.J.
Quiet time, my time. I'm going out to get coffee. I'm learning to free-base
this stuff, but that's what it takes to keep this life livable; peace and
quiet and an IV of caffeine. Can I get you anything?

TOBY
I'm good.

C.J.
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Let me get it. You take your nap.

C.J.
Really?

CHARLIE
It's either that or we pad the walls of your office. What do you have?

C.J.
I want a double shot, light on the soy, cinnamon-chai, light on the
mocha-chino, no whip, sprinkles, and another shot on top.

She has gotten money out for Charlie to go. He looks dumbfounded at her
order. She hands him the money.

C.J.
I'll write it down.

CUT TO: INT. - SANTOS PLANE - DAY

Leo and Annabeth are getting ready to go.

ANNABETH
Can you help me with this?

LEO
Sure.

He grabs her bag and hefts it up into the overhead compartment.

LEO
This is a lot, isn't it?

ANNABETH
I never know when I'll need an extra set of everything.

She sits down and gets out a pill bottle. Leo sits down next to her, looking
at the pill bottle. She takes two pills and throws her head back in order
to swallow them.

LEO
Are you alright?

ANNABETH
Oh, I'm fine. It's just a little process I go through when I fly.

LEO
What process is that?

ANNABETH
I wash back two of these little anti-anxiety pills with a few flutes of
champagne, and I'm fine.

A flight attendant walks up carrying a tray that has two glasses of champagne.

ANNABETH
Thank you, Lauren.

Annabeth downs the first glass very quickly.

LEO
You realize it's a short flight?

She looks at him for a moment and then drinks the second one slower than
she did the first.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated in one of the chairs while he is reading something. Debbie
comes to the door and knocks.

DEBBIE
Sir?

BARTLET
Has the Speaker called back yet?

DEBBIE
No, sir. I think he's on to the fact that you're inviting him to the funeral
where there's a fifty-fifty chance he'll wind up dead.

BARTLET
Coward.

DEBBIE
I wanted to remind you that the reception for new board members at the
Kennedy Center will be in the lobby at 8:00 pm.

BARTLET
Fine.

She turns to leave.

BARTLET
Have a seat.

DEBBIE
Sir?

BARTLET
Sit with me a minute.

She sits down on the couch closest to Bartlet.

BARTLET
Who's performing tonight?

DEBBIE
Oh, the Vlassenko Septet will be playing Mozart.

BARTLET
Did you know that Mozart's father believed his son to be a miracle from
God? He was so convinced of this that he forced young Wolfgang to play
all over Europe. His father felt it was his duty, in a world where no one
believed in miracles anymore, to show them God's latest.

Nancy comes in.

NANCY
Mr. McGarry's on the line for the President.

Bartlet gets up to go to his desk.

BARTLET
Tahnk you.

DEBBIE
And how did young Wolfgang feel about being hauled around like a trained
monkey?

BARTLET
It pretty much screwed him up for life.

Bartlet picks up the phone and Debbie leaves.

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO [VO]
Mr. President.

BARTLET
When do you get in?

LEO [VO]
About an hour.

BARTLET
Really? Things must be slow on the campaign trail.

LEO [VO]
Mr. President, I've been served a subpoena to appear before Congress.

CUT TO: INT. - SENATE HEARING ROOM - DAY

Margaret is still testifying before the committee. Dresden is asking questions.

DRESDEN
At 7:23 on the morning of June 20th, Ms. Cregg called Mr. Brock on his
cell phone.

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

DRESDEN
Were you on that call?

MARGARET
I don't believe I was.

DRESDEN
You don't believe you were?

MARGARET
No, because my first recollection of learning of this call was from Ms. Cregg.

DRESDEN
So you connected the call, but you did not monitor its content?

MARGARET
I don't believe I connected that call.

DRESDEN
Categorically, can you say that...?

MARGARET
That is my best recollection.

DRESDEN
So what're saying, that your best recollection is that you don't remember
whether you connected that call or not?

MARGARET
My best recollection is that I did not connect that particular call.

DRESDEN
On the afternoon of the 29th, you received a call from Mr. Leo McGarry at
4:23 pm?

MARGARET
Yes.

DRESDEN
He was calling from his cell phone to discuss the New York Times' leak
article with C.J. Cregg?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

He looks at her as though he has tricked her into saying what he wanted
to hear.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J. is lying on the couch. She sits up. She looks up to try to find the
time. She gets up and goes to the door to Margaret's office. She finds
neither Charlie nor Margaret there. She leaves the door open as she goes to
her windows to open the shades. When she does, she sees Mr. Frost's reflection
in the window. She jumps in fright.

 FROST
Ms. Cregg.

C.J.
You scared me.

FROST
Charles Frost; we met once at the Agency.

C.J.
You've been calling me.

FROST
I have information concerning the assassination of Chairman Farad. It's
extremely sensitive. May I sit?

C.J.
You briefed Arnold Vinick?

FROST
I need five minutes with the President.

C.J.
No problem.

FROST
The assassination of Chairman Farad is not what they've been telling you.

C.J.
And what have they been telling me?

FROST
That the assassin was a student extremist with pockets full of TATP; that
he was an individual acting on his own; this was a carefully organized act
and there are more coming.

C.J.
Did you take this through channels?

FROST
I have been attempting to for weeks but no one has been taking the larger
threat seriously.

C.J.
What larger threat?

FROST
The assassination of Chairman Farad is linked to another assassination that
will be carried out within the next few days and another that will be carried
out in weeks to come. The next target will be in Kazakhstan. Rushon Issetov.

C.J.
The President.

FROST
The strongest leader in the region. No one here will care that he is gone but
the future of Kazakhstan will be thrown into chaos. The third assassination
will be the regional Vice President of UNOCAL. I just need five minutes.

CUT TO: INT. - SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Santos is having his picture taken by several press photographers. Josh and
Lou are talking.

LOU
This could be the beginning. We could do a big speech on faith and public
values. He could offer himself up as the buckle on the bible belt.

JOSH
15% of our base are secular voters.

Ned walks up.

NED
Josh. Leo.

He hands him a phone. Josh takes it and walks away a few steps.

JOSH
Hey.

CUT TO: INT. - SANTOS PLANE - CONTINUOUS

Leo is in his seat. He is on the phone, talking to Josh.

LEO
You reminded him to stay off the Old Testament?

JOSH [VO]
I'm trying. How are you guys doing?

LEO
Make sure he doesn't take questions from the press.

JOSH [VO]
Yeah, I'm on it.

We see that Annabeth is leaned over in her chair asleep. She has her head
on a pillow and she is holding Leo's free hand with both of hers.

LEO
How's the rest of the day look?

JOSH [VO]
Same as always; photo op followed by round table followed by photo op.

LEO
Have you told the Congressman yet?

JOSH [VO]
I haven't had the chance.

CUT TO: INT. - SCHOOL HALL - CONTINUOUS

JOSH [cont.]
Did you call the President?

I did.

JOSH

LEO
I'll call you after?

CUT TO: INT. - SCHOOL HALL - CONTINUOUS

RONNA
The round table's starting.

JOSH

JOSH
Yeah, come on.

Josh closes the phone and he and Ronna walk over to the room where the round
table is taking place.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Toby and Kate are talking.

TOBY
Any update on the funeral?

KATE
What time do you brief?

TOBY
5:00.

KATE
I'll let you know.

TOBY
I have some Farad remarks for the President to make at tonight's recital.

KATE
Great.

TOBY
I was wondering if maybe you needed to look at them.

KATE
No, I think anything that I would notice C.J. would notice.

TOBY
Sure.

KATE
What are you digging for?

He shakes his head.

TOBY
How'd your testimony go?

KATE
It's been postponed. Apparently, Margaret's still up there.

Toby walks off and Charlie joins Kate.

CHARLIE
You got my message?

KATE
Yeah, I was on my way to you.

CHARLIE
I'll let her know you're here.

They have walked into Margaret's office. Charlie picks up the phone and
calls C.J.

CHARLIE
Kate Harper.

He hangs up the phone.

CHARLIE
You can go in.

She walks into C.J.'s office.

C.J.
We need to talk.

KATE
I got the name of the analyst who briefed Vinick.

C.J.
Charles Frost. I just spent 20 minutes with him.

KATE
Here?

C.J.
He said some things.

KATE
I'm gonna have his ass.

C.J.
Why are analysts under your purview coming to me, independently...?

KATE
I apologize and I assure you I'm going to have his paranoid ass.

C.J.
Are we sending lunatics to brief the Republicans?

KATE
It won't happen again.

C.J.
He said there was going to be another assassination.

KATE
In Kazakhstan.

C.J.
President Issetov. He said it was related to Farad.

KATE
We have no intelligence to support that theory.

C.J.
I feel so much better.

KATE
Frost is a good analyst. He knows the region better than anyone but he's
also wrong as often as he is right.

C.J.
Is he still briefing Vinick?

KATE
Not after what happened yesterday. Let me take care of this.

She turns to leave. C.J. gets up from her couch and walks over to the desk.

C.J.
He also said some VP of UNOCAL was going to be assassinated.

KATE
Yeah.

She walks out into Margaret's office to use the phone. Charlie walks in with
a messenger who is holding a piece of paper.

CHARLIE
C.J., this just came over from the Counsel's office.

C.J.
What is it?

CHARLIE
I'm pretty sure it's a subpoena.

The messenger walks over to her and hands her the piece of paper.

CUT TO: INT. - CLASSROOM - DAY

Santos is talking with a classroom full of parents and teachers. Josh and
Lou are at the back of the room watching it.

SANTOS
We are in an information age and we have a school system that is practically
a relic of the agrarian age. The best teachers will tell you themselves,
we have to raise standards for teachers. We have to. We should pay them
like professionals. And, yes, we should hold them to higher professional
standards as well.

Everyone in the audience applauds. Several people raise their hands. Santos
points to a woman. She stands.

ROCHELLE BANKS
Congressman Santos, do you believe in the theory of Intelligent Design?

SANTOS
What's your name?

BANKS
Rochelle Banks. I teach 10th grade science here at the school.

SANTOS
Well, Rochelle, as a Catholic who attends church every Sunday I do believe
in God and my faith tells me that there was a designer behind it.

JOSH
It's time for us to leave.

LOU
The school?

JOSH
The state.

Santos picks out another person who stands.

SANTOS
Yes, sir. Uh, what's your name?

CLIFFORD REYNOLDS
Clifford Reynolds. I teach English here at Leonard.

SANTOS
Nice to meet you, Clifford.

REYNOLDS
Thanks. May I ask you if you believe in the theory of evolution?

SANTOS
Well, I think it'd be very difficult to teach geology, anthropology, and
zoology without evolution, so yes, I do. I don't believe it's contradictory
to believe in science and believe in God.

REYNOLDS
Do you believe that the theory of Intelligent Design and the Theory of
Evolution should be taught alongside each other in the public schools?

SANTOS
Absolutely not. One is based on science, the other is based on
faith. Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory, it's a religious
belief. And our Constitution does not allow for the teaching of religion in
our public schools.

REYNOLDS
Many of us here would be more comfortable if our children were taught all
points of view.

SANTOS
And I'm all for that. Evolution is not perfect. It doesn't answer every
question but it is based on scientific facts; facts that can be predicted,
tested, and proven. Intelligent Design asks theological questions. I'm sure
that many of us would agree that at the beginning of all that begat-ing,
something begun.

The people laugh.

SANTOS
What was that something?

REYNOLDS
Congressman Santos, many of us want a version of science taught to our kids
that's in accordance with our beliefs.

SANTOS
I understand. But can't we agree that the inclusion of non-scientific
explanations into the science curriculum of our schools misrepresents the
nature of science? And therefore compromises a central purpose in our public
education which is the preparation of a scientifically literate workforce. If
you have a problem with your child's education, get involved. If you have a
problem with what the School Board wants to teach, run for School Board. We
can never forget that the best way to preserve our democracy is to take part
in it. Thanks for your question. Thank you all.

Josh looks stunned as the room stands to applaud.

SANTOS
Thank you.

JOSH
I'll be damned.

We follow Santos as he walks out into the hallway where the press is waiting
for him.

REPORTER #1
Congressman, do you apologize for your comments about separation of church
and state?

REPORTER #2
Congressman, as a Catholic, do you advocate the teaching of Intelligent
Design to children attending Catholic school?

SANTOS
Just because I'm talking about my faith doesn't mean I don't believe in the
separation of church and state.

REPORTER #1
Congressman Santos, do you believe Senator Vinick believes in Intelligent
Design?

SANTOS
Well, I don't know. You'd have to ask him that.

Santos heads off down a flight of stairs. Josh, Lou, Ronna, and Ned follow him.

LOU
Did what I think just happened just happen?

JOSH
Ted.

NED
My name is Ned.

JOSH
Where's the nearest TV?

CUT TO: INT. - LOUNGE - DAY

Josh, Lou, and Ned are watching Vinick, who is on TV talking to the press.

VINICK
As you know, the Supreme Court does not allow the teaching of religion in
public schools.

LOU
Come on.

VINICK
This is a local responsibility, not a federal one.

LOU
You can do better than that.

REPORTER [on TV]
Senator, some of the Christian right are still looking for a reason to vote
for you. Can you afford to keep alienating them?

VINICK
Thank you.

He walks away from the podium.

LOU
Ouch.

NED
That's when Vinick's people jumped in and ended the Q&amp;A.

He turns off the TV.

JOSH
Ended the Q&amp;A!

Ronna walks in.

RONNA
Josh, Meet the Press just called. They want to bump Leo and open the show
with Santos and his views on religion and education. And nightline called
about Monday's segment.

JOSH
Where's the Congressman?

He, Lou, and Ned follow Ronna out.

Bartlet is on the phone with Haffley. C.J. comes in from her office.

BARTLET
Yes, Mr. Speaker. ... I appreciate the support. ... Thank you.

He hangs up. He goes about signing some things on his desk.

BARTLET
The Speaker's in.

C.J.
We're close to having a full house on Air Force One.

BARTLET
Any word from the Russian ambassador whether Chigorin's coming?

C.J.
No, but you can corner him at tonight's recital.

BARTLET
Yeah.

C.J.
Wheels-up for the funeral is 9:00 am tomorrow. Agent Butterfield will be
briefing you security issues on the plane.

BARTLET
Fine.

C.J.
Santos seems to have turned the tables on Vinick.

BARTLET
Yes.

C.J.
I understand Leo called.

BARTLET
Yeah.

He gets up to leave.

C.J.
Thank you, sir.

He leaves through one door, C.J. through another.

CUT TO: INT. - SANTOS HQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Leo is seated in the conference room. A lawyer named Barry comes in and
shakes Leo's hand. They sit.

LEO
Barry!

BARRY
Mr. Vice President!

LEO
Please.

BARRY
I can't tell you how comforted we all are by your presence on the ticket. Awful
about Farad.

LEO
How do we protect ourselves from a guy dressed in dynamite? I appreciate
your taking the time to come by.

BARRY

LEO
I've been served a subpoena to appear before the Intelligence Committee
investigating the White House leak.

BARRY
You could claim executive privilege.

LEO
I wasn't Chief of Staff when the leak occurred.

BARRY
But you were still working inside the White House?

LEO
Executive privilege isn't going to work. The President's has order all White
House personnel to cooperate.

BARRY
So you were working inside the White House, without a title, with the
individual who's now become the primary focus of a criminal investigation?

LEO
Yes.

BARRY
So a candidate for the Vice Presidency with a history of alcoholism and
heart disease was working inside the White House when a major of national
security occurred and is now going to be dropped off at the press-infested
Hart building with his lawyer to testify before a Republican Congressional
committee investigating a Democratic administration's failure to competently
protect the Presidency.

LEO
Any way I can protect the Santos campaign?

BARRY
When do you go before the Committee?

LEO
Monday.

BARRY
Well, we can talk about protecting you, but as far as the Santos campaign
is concerned: you are just a guy dressed in dynamite.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated on one of the couches and he is reading something. Debbie
knocks and opens the door. She shows Toby in.

TOBY
Thank you. You wanted to see me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Toby, come on in.

Debbie leaves and shuts the door.

TOBY
You read my draft?

BARTLET
I made a few changes but... have a seat.

Toby sits down in a chair.

TOBY
Thank you, sir. What changes?

Bartlet says nothing.

TOBY
Do we know more about the bomber?

BARTLET
He was a student. A 23-year-old from an upper-middle class family. When he
wasn't at school he spent hours at the mosque studying and praying.

TOBY
Churchill said, "A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change
the subject."

BARTLET
I pushed him.

TOBY
Farad?

BARTLET
Farad didn't think the peace would work. I pushed him into doing it. [pause]
Leo called. He's coming to town to do the Sunday morning shows. He's also
coming to see his attorney. It seems he's been served a subpoena to testify.

TOBY
Leo can't pull up to the Hart building in a limo. The Vice Presidential
candidate can't testify. It'll be the end of the Santos campaign.

BARTLET
The investigation into the leak is focused on C.J.

TOBY
They've got it wrong.

BARTLET
Apparently, they don't see it that way.

Debbie knocks and reenters.

DEBBIE
You need to dress for the recital, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

He gets up and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - SANTOS HQ - HALLWAY - DAY

Leo comes out of the conference room and Annabeth is waiting for him.

ANNABETH
How'd it go?

He doesn't answer but walks a bit past her before she starts walking with him.

ANNABETH
Try to get some sleep. The motorcade's going to pick you up at 7:00 am sharp
at your hotel. Now, once you wrap it up with Russert you have a thirty minute
window to get to Face the Nation followed by a sit-down with the Post.

They have come to an elevator and Leo pushes the button.

LEO
Don't you ever get tired?

ANNABETH
No.

LEO
And how is that?

ANNABETH
I graduated cum laude with a degree in art history and if you'd have told
me I'd end up here...

The elevator dings and the door opens.

ANNABETH [cont.]
Let's just say I love my job.

They get in the elevator.

LEO
What time is it?

She hands him his watch as he pushes the button.

ANNABETH
Headed back to your hotel?

LEO
Yeah. It's been a day.

ANNABETH
Hmm.

LEO
What are you up to?

ANNABETH
Heading back to me apartment and a nice, hot bath.

LEO
You feel like dinner?

ANNABETH
I do, but...

LEO
We'll get a bite. It's early.

ANNABETH
Thanks, but no.

There is an awkward silence.

ANNABETH
I just think it's better while we're spending so much time together that we
try and keep our distance whenever possible.

LEO
Keep our distance?

ANNABETH
Because of the tension.

She gets off and Leo looks confused.

LEO
What tension?

CUT TO: INT. - LIMO - NIGHT

Josh, Santos, and Lou are in the limo on their way to the last stump of

LOU
Last education stump of the day, and then back to the hotel. I'll let you

The limo stops in front of the building.

LOU
I'll see you inside. Thank you.

She grabs her things and gets out.

SANTOS
You want to talk?

JOSH
How you doing?

SANTOS
I'm good. Good.

JOSH
Joey Lucas called; said there might be some movement in the polls. All the
Sunday morning shows are going to make Matt Santos' Education Week the elite
political story.

SANTOS
Imagine that.

JOSH
We came here to talk about education, and we spent the whole day getting
people to talk about education.

SANTOS
Sometimes a little religion helps the medicine go down.

JOSH
Leo got subpoenaed.

SANTOS
When does he appear?

JOSH
Monday.

Lou opens the door for them to get out.

LOU
Okay, ready.

Santos climbs out.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

A few people are gathered around the table when C.J. comes in. She walks
over to where Kate and Slattery are standing.

C.J.
The President will be leaving for Jerusalem first thing in the morning.

SLATTERY
Will Zahavy be attending the funeral?

C.J.
He's afraid his presence will provoke a reaction from the Palestinian
hard-liners.

Kate goes over to a map. C.J. follows her.

KATE
In preparation for the funeral, we're deploying more of our own peacekeeping
troops as a precaution here and here.

C.J.
How long until they're in position?

KATE
The regional commander said six hours.

She looks over as she is talking to Kate and notices something on one of
the other boards.

C.J.
Any other activity?

KATE
No. The Israelis have halted there tanks for now.

C.J.
What's that?

SLATTERY
We have what appears to be another assassination.

C.J.
Kazakhstan.

KATE
Who?

SLATTERY
The President. Standard turmoil in the region.

C.J.
Issetov?

He looks stunned that she knew it.

SLATTERY
That's right.

C.J.
I want you to tell me everything you can about the assassin as soon as you
possible. Somebody get our ambassador to Kazakhstan and I want the region
office to UNOCAL on the phone now.

Kate moves to make the call.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bartlet is speaking at the reception.

BARTLET
Before we recognize tonight's Kennedy Center Board, I'd like to take a
moment. Chairman Farad was my friend. Together, with Israeli Prime Minister
Zahavy, we pursued the challenge of a brave and just peace. Our goal was a
better future for the children. But old enemies die hard and last night hatred
and fear took our friend in a senseless act of cowardice. How then should
we respond to such violence and despair? I know that Chairman Farad would
want us to take a moment to remember those innocent victims who perished with
him. They were seven students studying at universities in Jerusalem. And their
names are: Salim Saida, age 19, Palestinian; Akiva Eshkol, age 23, Israeli...

CUT TO: INT. - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Santos is speaking to a group of young musicians and there is press and
parents behind them.

SANTOS
To be a person of faith is to have the world challenge that faith. Was the
universe designed by God? That's up to everyone in this country to decide
for themselves because the framers of our Constitution believed that if the
people were to be sovereign and belong to different religions at the same
time then our official religion would have to be no religion at all. It was a
bold experiment then, as it is now. It wasn't meant to make us comfortable. It
was meant to make us free.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

We hear the performers begin to play.

CUT TO: INT. - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Santos is watching the young musicians play.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The elder, more experienced performers are playing. A contrast can be made
between the older players playing in the White House and the younger, less
experienced players in the classroom.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

We see Margaret walking down the hallway toward her office. She walks in and
sets her purse down just as Kate walks in to talk to C.J. She goes into the
office where C.J. is waiting.

C.J.
You got anything?

KATE
Nothing new.

C.J.
Have you talked to Agent Frost?

KATE
He's... no one's been able to track him down.

C.J.
He's missing?


KATE

I can't say that yet. He'll turn up by morning.



C.J.

You should go home.



KATE

We both should.



C.J.

I'm leaving soon.


KATE
I'll let you know if anything happens.

She walks out and Toby walks in.

C.J.
Good evening. You would not believe the day I've had. I'd tell you about it
if I could talk about it, but a bunch of stuff happened today that I can't
talk about so I guess I should stop talking about it.

She walks out into Margaret's office and hands a folder to Margaret. She
seems surprised that Margaret is back. She walks back into her office.

C.J.
But the truth is I'm so strung out and wired on caffeine I can't even tell
what room I'm in.

TOBY
C.J.

She gets up and closes the doors.

C.J.
Let's open that bottle of champagne you gave me for my birthday. Maybe the
alcohol will balance out the caffeine.

TOBY
C.J., the leak...

She gets a bottle of champagne and two glasses out of her closet. She brings
them over to her desk.

C.J.
Let's have a toast. One final toast before I leave the White House for my
perp walk in leg irons. Here, you open it. I'll put your eye out.

TOBY
C.J.

C.J.
Fine, I'll open it. But just, uh, listen to what I have to say. Leo's
in trouble.

TOBY
I know.

C.J.
You do?

TOBY
I got a lawyer.

He comes and sits down next to her.

C.J.
What?

TOBY
I got a lawyer.

She looks up as though she knows what he is going to say. He clears his throat.

TOBY
I did it.

We see a close up shot of both their faces as they look at each other.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
