TEASER

FADE IN: INT. - WEDDING HALL - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

Rehearsal is going on for Ellie's wedding. Bartlet is practicing his walking
Ellie down the aisle. They walk arm in arm and Bartlet is humming to the
wedding music that is playing.

ELLIE
Dad, you're not really going to sing along.

BARTLET
I thought I had a solo.

ELLIE
Or tell jokes.

BARTLET
None?

ELLIE
After the ceremony, short ones, preferably not during the toast.

BARTLET
I have to give a toast?

ELLIE
Dad.

They have come to the front where Vic is standing. Shirley, the social
secretary is standing to the side, giving orders.

SHIRLEY
Turn to face the bride. Now you lift the veil.

Bartlet makes a motion as though he were lifting an imaginary veil from
Ellie's face.

SHIRLEY
Give her a kiss.

He gives her a kiss on the cheek.

SHIRLEY
Walk over here.

She guides him to his seat. Abbey is sitting next to it.

SHIRLEY
And sit.

BARTLET
Kind of far from the action, isn't it?

ABBEY
You're not performing the ceremony.

BARTLET
I wasn't asked to.

C.J. walks up and sits down behind Bartlet and Abbey.

C.J.
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt.

ABBEY
No, that's quite all right. He was about to go into his Spencer Tracy routine.

C.J.
There's been an escalation in Kazakhstan. We picked up three Russian military
convoys headed for the border.

BARTLET
[to Abbey] I'm going to need to step out.

He stands and walks over to where Ellie, Vic, and the priest are standing.

BARTLET
Uh, my apologies, everyone. I'm afraid I'll have to meet you at dinner. Don't
slip away, young lady.

He kisses her on the cheek.

BARTLET
We need to practice our dance. Father.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Bartlet and C.J. walk into the office. Kate and Debbie are already there.

DEBBIE
I told them you were busy.

BARTLET
Yeah.

DEBBIE
I hear there's a rehearsal dinner tonight. Swanky event, President of the
United States is supposed to show. He's got 15 minutes.

They walk in to the Oval Office.

BARTLET
So now the Russians are invading.

KATE
We just got off the phone with State. The Russians say they're sending in
advisors at the Kazakh President's request.

BARTLET
Advisors with AK-47s and riot gear?

KATE
Pretty much.

C.J.
President Tarimov's got to be nervous with the Chinese camped out at the
border and his own people ready to storm the palace gate.

BARTLET
Not nervous enough to reschedule elections. The Chinese seeing what we're
seeing?

C.J.
The Chinese won't enter the country unprovoked, but if those convoys cross
the border...

BARTLET
Debbie!

Debbie comes in, carrying a stopwatch.

DEBBIE
38 seconds. Nice work, Commander.

BARTLET
I'm going to need the Russian Ambassador, the Chinese Ambassador, and my wife;
probably not in that order.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
      8:30 PM

Bartlet is on the phone with the Russian Ambassador. C.J. and Kate are
listening in.

BARTLET
Yes, Mr. Ambassador, but if we can focus on... Yes, Yuri. Yes, it should be
a lovely affair, but... but, listen, if those convoys enter Kazakhstan...


He looks at C.J. and she shrugs her shoulders.

BARTLET
No, I'm not sure who's doing the flower arrangements.

C.J. cuts in.

C.J.
Mr. President, I hate to interrupt but we've got Secretary Hutchinson on
the other line.

BARTLET
Thank you, C.J. Yuri, you'll communicate my concerns to President
Chigorin? ... Yes, we'll speak later. ... Thank you.

They hang up.

BARTLET
Flower arrangements.

KATE
He's stalling.

BARTLET
Where are the convoys?

C.J.
30 miles from the border.

KATE
Pakistan just issued a statement warning that Chinese interference in Central
Asia will not be tolerated.

C.J.
You want the Chinese Ambassador?

BARTLET
Get him on the phone.

Debbie goes back into her office to make the call.

      THE WESTIN, PHILADELPHIA, PA

The elevator doors open and Donna gets out. She walks to a door that has a
piece of paper that says "PRESS ROOM" taped on it. She walks in.

DONNA
Hey, I just wanted to give you guys a heads-up. Governor Baker has decided
to join us at tomorrow morning's rally. We've added a half hour to the event.

MALE REPORTER
What about the wedding?

DONNA
We'll be wheels-up at noon. The Congressman should have plenty of time to
get to the White House.

FEMALE REPORTER
Have you seen the new Zogby polls?

DONNA
I have.

FEMALE REPORTER
Six weeks to go, you're still seven points down. Are you guys concerned?

DONNA
We drew record crowds in Jersey today, we got a four-point bump in the debate,
the economists said a Santos Presidency might be the best thing to happen
to race relations in this country since the Civil Rights Act. I'd say we're
gaining ground.

FEMALE REPORTER
You haven't been... You haven't been within five points of Vinick in a month.

DONNA
We're a little more focused on the state polls.

FEMALE REPORTER
I've got a senior Democrat on record saying it's time to shake things up.

DONNA
He should look at a map, do the electoral math. This race is tighter than
you think.

She leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Santos, Leo, Josh, and Lou are looking at a US map on a dry erase board. Some
states are colored Red, some Blue.

SANTOS
Do we really want to go dark in Arizona?

LOU
We picked up two points there last week.

JOSH
We're still trailing by seven.

SANTOS
We can't pull the money from anywhere else?

JOSH
Vinick's challenging us across the board. With California in his pocket
we have to sweep Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. That means putting
every available dollar into those four states.

LEO
We've cut all we can out of the places we're actually competitive.

SANTOS
Okay. We move the ad money from Arizona into Houston and Miami.

Josh starts making some notes on the board.

LEO
We done with the bloodletting?

JOSH
We go dark in Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona. These 12 are
still in play.

SANTOS
I'll try to catch my kids before they go to sleep.

JOSH
Good night, sir.

LOU
Good night.

Josh and Lou leave.

SANTOS
Leo. You guys have to narrow down the board like this eight years ago?

LEO
Sure. Six weeks out, only so much in the war chest, you've got to manage
your resources.

SANTOS
It feels like we're closing a lot of doors.

LEO
Good strategy always does.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Bartlet is on the phone with the Chinese Ambassador. C.J. is listening in.

BARTLET
Yes, of course, Mr. Ambassador, but... We've been over this: it's three
convoys, they're not invading. ... Yes, but as I've said... if the Chinese
Army enters the country...

Kate comes in.

BARTLET
Yes, I'll convey your thoughts. ... Yes. You too, Yahlin. Thank you.

They hang up.

BARTLET
How long before the convoys reach Kazakhstan?

KATE
Actually, they've stopped a few miles from the border.

BARTLET
Are they refueling or pitching tents?

KATE
Hard to know.

BARTLET
I'm going to go with tents. I want a full briefing in the morning.

He puts his jacket on and starts gathering his stuff.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
If those convoys start moving again...

C.J.
Right.

BARTLET
Good night.

BOTH
Good night.

He leaves.

KATE
Do you want me to follow up with Berryhill?

C.J.
No, I got it.

They walk out into C.J.'s office.

KATE
Alright if I...

C.J.
Yeah. No, wait a minute. The Chinese Ambassador's coming to the wedding.

KATE
Okay.

C.J.
I can't remember who he's sitting with.

KATE
Hopefully not the Russians. State eyeballed the seating chart, right?

C.J.
One of Berryhill's deputies, a couple of weeks ago.

KATE
Maybe I should take a look.

C.J.
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Josh, Lou, and Bram are standing at a table.

BRAM
Philadelphia fundraising totals, and the changes to tomorrow's schedule.

JOSH
Thanks.

BRAM
If you could sign off on those before you leave for DC.

JOSH
Yeah.

LOU
Five states dark. A lot of contested Congressional races, a lot of guys are
going to have trouble getting Democrats to the polls if we jump ship.


JOSH
Yeah, we're not going to be very popular.

LOU
You want the new tracking numbers before we go public?

JOSH
Sure.

Donna walks in. She is on the phone.

DONNA
Right, and we'll want local press from south Jersey and the Philly
suburbs. ... Great, thanks Edie.

JOSH
Did you get the photo op with the Governor?

DONNA
Santos, Baker, and a cheese-steak.

JOSH
Make it a hoagie.

DONNA
Advance said he should get a cheese-steak.

JOSH
Trust me, make it a hoagie.

DONNA
The press is a little antsy.

JOSH
Yeah, tell them national polls are meaningless.

DONNA
The staff's a little antsy, too.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
You guys have been behind closed doors since we got to Philly.

JOSH
Killer game of Boggle.

DONNA
Since we got to Philly.

JOSH
Donna...

DONNA
There's a rumor we're pulling out of Arizona.

JOSH
Okay, I need you to kill that rumor.

DONNA
Is it because we're moving money into Illinois?

LOU
Josh. Joshua, we just picked up five points in Illinois.

JOSH
What?

LOU
Illinois tracking poll.

JOSH
We're down by nine points.

LOU
Not anymore.

They walk back into the war room.

SANTOS
What's going on?

LOU
We're only down four in Illinois.

SANTOS
Really?

LEO
We've barely spent any money there.

SANTOS
[into phone] All right, let me call you back.

JOSH
This could be a mistake. We should have Joey rerun this in the morning.

LEO
No, this has got to be the Trib.

SANTOS
The Tribune Endorsement put us within four?

LOU
Wow.

LEO
Four points, the state's in play.

LOU
We need a big media buy, huge. Maybe a swing through Chicago this week.


SANTOS
21 electoral votes.

LEO
Close a door, open a roof.

LOU
I'm thinking a 1500 rating points buy, maybe 2000.

JOSH
Where the hell are we going to get the money?

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Abbey is sitting in a chair as Bartlet has walked in.

ABBEY
Nice of you to drop by.

BARTLET
I missed dinner.

ABBEY
Only by an hour and a half.

He gives her a kiss.

ABBEY
Don't worry. Ellie had a wonderful time. I, on the other hand, was stuck in
the corner with Vic's uncle, a botanist. You would have liked him.

BARTLET
I'm getting too old for this job.

ABBEY
Really? It was their relatives, who we don't particularly know, and our
relatives, who we don't particularly like. They understood. The Faisons were
so busy playing host they barely noticed. Although we did decide on Uncle
Norman as a possible stand-in for you tomorrow.

BARTLET
Stand-in?

ABBEY
Worst-case scenario.

BARTLET
Uncle Norman?

ABBEY
He is a bit of a tippler, but he's reliably punctual when there's an open
bar. You'll have time to practice the dance with Ellie before the wedding.

BARTLET
I'll find her tomorrow.

ABBEY
Sure. Well, we do have the foreign dignitaries gift reception starting with
the Bermudian Ambassador at 9:00.

BARTLET
Okay.

ABBEY
And hair at 10:00, makeup at 11:30...

      HEADQUARTERS, 10:30 PM

Josh and Lou are walking and talking.

LOU
Maybe we pull some money out of New York.

JOSH
No, we need to be at full force in New York so we can shore up Northern Jersey.

LOU
What about Missouri?

JOSH
We're starting to see some movement in the Independents in St. Louis.

LOU
Iowa?

JOSH
Yeah, but Chicago's pretty pricey. Des Moines and Cedar Rapids won't make
much of a dent.

LOU
I was really looking forward to a hot bath.

They have walked to Edie's desk.

JOSH
Well, conference room, five minutes.

EDIE
Three day schedule, point buys for the weekend, couple of calls.

JOSH
Yeah, anything urgent?

EDIE
You got ten state party chairs worried you're going to pull local advertising.

JOSH
Anything else?

EDIE
Folks in Illinois seem pretty excited.

JOSH
Yeah? Who called?

EDIE
Uh, Congressman Sloan, Gabus, Arrow, Leiter, two Senators and the Governor.

JOSH
What about the guy who's running the DNC field operation in Chicago?

EDIE
Three times in the last half hour.

JOSH
Get him on the phone. See if we can fit him in for breakfast tomorrow.

EDIE
Okay, you realize you have a breakfast every half hour between 8:00 and 1:00?

JOSH
The later ones must be lunches.

Josh's phone rings. He answers it.

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA [VO]
Tomorrow's photo op?

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

Donna is sitting at a table. Josh is on speakerphone. Bram and some other
workers are also at the table.

DONNA
The Governor's office said Baker'll be having a cheesesteak.

JOSH [VO]
Okay?

DONNA
Howard in Advance is worried about the comparative visual.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
They think the hoagie's gonna look weak?

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

DONNA
I believe his exact words were "pansy-assed."

JOSH [VO]
Howard's from Philly, right?

DONNA
Uh-huh.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Okay. Go with the cheesesteak.

DONNA [VO]
Yeah.

JOSH
But prep him on how to order it: no Swiss, no Munster, just sauce and whiz.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

DONNA
Whiz?

JOSH [VO]
Cheese whiz. Ask Howard.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH [cont.]
And no onions. He's got a photo op with the President at the wedding. I
don't want him knocking him over with the breath.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

DONNA
Got it. Thanks guys.

She picks up the receiver to talk directly to Josh as the others get up and
walk away.

DONNA
I'm getting calls about Illinois.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Tell 'em we're excited.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

DONNA
The press is wondering who decided not to contest the state.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Tell 'em I did. Tell 'em I also made the decision not to contest Georgia,
where we're down by 11, and not to contest Mississippi, where we're down by 15.

Lou walks to his door.

LOU
You ready?

JOSH
Yeah. [to Donna] I've got to go.

He hangs up.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - PA - CONTINUOUS

Donna hangs up.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Abbey and Bartlet are talking.

ABBEY
I think I can pencil you in between the photos and the ceremony.

BARTLET
Yeah.

ABBEY
So, rumor has it you're going to have a chat with the groom tomorrow morning.

BARTLET
I am.

ABBEY
Well, that will be lovely, I'm sure.

BARTLET
What, I did it with Doug.

ABBEY
Yeah. I don't recall that as being unqualified success.

BARTLET
Well, now I've had a run at it.

ABBEY
You do know that talking him out of marrying your daughter is not an option.

BARTLET
Yeah.

He looks at some papers and seems distracted.

BARTLET
You really think it's not an option.

She looks at him matter-of-factly and gets up.

CUT TO: INT. - CONFERENCE ROOM - SANTOS HQ - NIGHT

Josh and Lou are discussing the money for their ad buy.

JOSH
New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin.

He gets up and starts marking on the board.

JOSH
We pull out of the original five, we go dark in New Hampshire, we half the
ad buy in Wisconsin and Iowa.

LOU
You're sure?

He looks at the board for a few moments, contemplating.

JOSH
Yeah.

LOU
Hallelujah. Do you want me to call the media team?


JOSH
No. I'm meeting with a couple of congressmen from Wisconsin tomorrow. Let
me break the news to them first.

LOU
Okay. I'm gonna head out.

JOSH
Wait.

LOU
Ohh!

JOSH
No, this is right. We got it.

As Lou walks away, Josh walks into the main room to where a TV has a news
story running about Santos' bump in Illinois.

MIKE DIACOVO
They picked up five points in Illinois, great. But the question we need to
be asking is: "Why wasn't Santos there in the first place?" If you ask me,
it's a pretty big tactical error on the part of Josh Lyman.

Lou comes back in.

LOU
You need a ride?

JOSH
No, I've still got to finish up some things.

LOU
Suit yourself.

DIACOVO
... should have been watching the sampling data. Of course, this campaign is
still salvageable, but he certainly can't afford to make another Illinois-sized
mistake, which is why I think some people have begun to question whether
Josh Lyman is the right person to take the Santo's campaign down the stretch.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - WILL'S OFFICE - DAY

Will is sitting at his desk and he is watching a tape of a press briefing
from earlier in which he is giving the rundown on Ellie's wedding to the
White House Press Corps.

WILL [on TV]
Uh, they'll be walking down the aisle to "Sorge Nel Petto," the aria Gaffredo
sings to his daughter in Handel's Rinaldo. The aria was picked for its beauty
and its text, which translates roughly to "a certain delight surges from my
breast and promises to calm my heart."

Kate comes to and leans against Will's door.

KATE
That's lovely.

WILL
I made it up. Don't tell.

KATE
There's nothing better on?

WILL
I like to start the weekend with a little post-game analysis just to stay
sharp.

WILL [on TV]
Uh, no. Ellie decided to go with the pau de soir Monique Lhuillier instead
of the lace Vera Wang.

KATE
Aha.

Will pauses the tape.

WILL
Is there something you need?

KATE
I need to take a look at the seating chart for the wedding reception.

Will gets it for her.

WILL
Sure.

KATE
Pau de soir?

WILL
Apparently its soft yet supple. Oh, and it drapes beautifully.

He brings her two large sheets of paper and she sits on his couch as she
starts to look over one of them. Will comes and sits next to her.

KATE
Who put the British royals at the table with the German Ambassador?

WILL
Ah, still smarting over the World Cup Match?

KATE
Well, that and the devaluation of the pound.

WILL
Right. How about we swap in the Swedish Ambassador?

KATE
Mm. The Queen and the Swedish Ambassador had a thing.

WILL
A thing?

KATE
It's a while back, but still...

WILL
Sure.

KATE
Do you mind if I take this for a little while.

He indicates that she can. She stands and leaves.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAFE - DAY

Leo walks up to the table where Josh is sitting. Josh is reading over some
electoral material.

LEO
Hey.

JOSH
New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin.

LEO
Good morning to you, too.

JOSH
You here to sit with Jerry?

LEO
And then Trautman and Alexander. You?

JOSH
Uh, Chicago field rep, Cooper, Steele, Golden, Walvick. I'm thinking New
Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin.

LEO
Did you get some sleep?

JOSH
We cut New Hampshire, pull money out of Iowa and Wisconsin.

LEO
Really, you've got to pace yourself.

JOSH
I mean, New Hampshire's a no-brainer.

LEO
I'm serious. You should be getting at least five hours.

JOSH
Only four electoral votes, we're paying a premium because the ad buy is out
of Boston.

LEO
Soon you're going to be at two hours a night and it only gets worse if we win.

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
New Hampshire?


JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
It's not worth the ad buy.

JOSH
Iowa and Wisconsin.

LEO
Iowa, sure. How much are we up in Wisconsin?

JOSH
Three points and the Illinois ad buy should carry into Wisconsin.

LEO
You consider cutbacks in Missouri?

JOSH
We're only down two points. I don't want to cede the state.

MAN
Leo!

LEO
Sounds right. I've got to go make nice with the fat cats.

JOSH
Well, pick some pockets will you.

LEO
Get some sleep.

JOSH
Yeah.

The Chicago field rep, STAN MITCHELL, walks up and introduces himself to
Josh as Leo is walking away.

STAN MITCHELL
Josh. Stan Mitchell, DNC field ops, Chicago.

JOSH
Stan, thanks for flying up.

MITCHELL
I've been telling you guys we've got a shot in Illinois. I just wish you'd
called sooner.

JOSH
Just tell me we can get the full field operation ready by November 8th.

MITCHELL
To be honest, you're asking for a six-month job in six weeks. Sure, we can
get it up, but its going to cost you.

Josh looks as though he thought that that statement might be coming.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - DAY

Ellie, Vic, and Abbey are accepting gifts from the Bermudian Ambassador. Vic
is pacing. Carol and a photographer are also there.

AMBASSADOR
In Bermuda, it is traditional to place a cedar sapling atop the wedding cake
and then plant it at the home of the bride and groom. I bring this sapling
from Warwick Pond, one of the few surviving cedar forests on the island. May
it grow with your love.

ELLIE
Thank you very much.

She stands to accept the gift.

AMBASSADOR
You are most welcome.

He stands beside her for the photographer to take the picture.

CAROL
Mr. Ambassador.

ABBEY
It's beautiful.

ELLIE
Yes.

ABBEY
We'll keep it off the cake.

ELLIE
Yes.

Carol ushers in the next ambassador, the French Ambassador.

CAROL
The French Ambassador, the honorable Julian Lefort.

ELLIE
Bonjour, Monsieur.

Abbey walks to the side of the room and speaks with Carol.

ABBEY
How many of these do we have?

CAROL
There were a couple of additions: the Greek Ambassador, the Latvians, the
Romanian Ambassador happens to be in town. All totaled, that brings us to 71.

ABBEY
The hairdresser comes at 10:00.

CAROL
Maybe we ought to skip Romania.

ABBEY
Or all of Eastern Europe.

Bartlet is speaking with his National Security Council.

BARTLET
The three convoys: they're still holding at the Kazakhstan border?

HUTCHINSON
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Their restraint is admirable.

HUTCHINSON
Maybe not. Our Keyhole satellites took these photographs of the Russian
military base in Omsk two hours ago.

BARTLET
It looks like a couple of battalions.

HUTCHINSON
Close to 100,000 men.

KATE
They've got to be posturing.

HUTCHINSON
Sure, but 100,000 Russians to the West, 1/6 of the Chinese Army to the East...

C.J.
We should consider evacuating the Marine base outside Ayaguz.

KATE
The base is critical to our interests in Central Asia.

HUTCHINSON
Not to mention that both sides are going to have one less reason to restrain
themselves once we pull out.

C.J.
Yeah, but you're talking about leaving 9,000 Marines in the middle of a
wrestling match between two 800,000-pould gorillas.

BARTLET
How do we get our men out?

KATE
Airlift to the Arabian Sea.

VIC
No, thank you.

DEBBIE
Coffee?

VIC
No.

DEBBIE

Bartlet is speaking.

BARTLET
How long will it take after I give the word?

HUTCHINSON
72 hours, assuming our ships are in position.

Debbie knocks.

BARTLET
Yeah.

She comes in.

DEBBIE
Your 9 o'clock is starting to melt.

BARTLET
Yeah, send him in.

She goes back outside to get Vic.

BARTLET
Move a dozen evac transports into the Arabian Sea and put them on ready alert.

HUTCHINSON
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
C.J., let's get the Kazakhstan Ambassador in here tomorrow. See if we can't
convince them to reschedule elections before their country becomes a rugby
field.

Vic comes to the door. Bartlet sees him.

BARTLET
Gentlemen, my future son-in-law.

The generals get up and go to shake his hand. There is several moments
of introductions, well-wishing, and hand-shaking, during which Vic looks
extremely uneasy. Bartlet looks as though he is fighting a smile.

C.J.
Tell me you didn't plan that.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAFE - DAY

Josh is meeting with a Congressman from Wisconsin.

CONGRESSMAN
If you go dark in Wisconsin...

JOSH
Congressman, we're just talking about trimming the ad buy.

CONGRESSMAN
If anything, we need more money in the state.

JOSH
We still have a 500-point buy in Green Bay, a 500-point buy in Milwaukee...

CONGRESSMAN
Vinick's got 1500 points out of Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison; he's outspending
you guys 2-to-1.

JOSH
I can try to have the Congressman make a few stops...

CONGRESSMAN
Come on. You know it's all about the media buy. Now look, I know Vinick's
pressuring you everywhere and I'm thrilled you made headway in Illinois,
but we've got six contested Congressional districts in Wisconsin, not to
mention a very tough Senate race.

Josh's phone begins to ring.

CONGRESSMAN [cont.]
Now, without nation ad support we could lose every one of those campaigns. Do
you need to take that?

JOSH
I do.

The Senator gets up.

CONGRESSMAN
You're up four in Michigan and three in Jersey; you should trim there.

JOSH
Thanks for coming by, Congressman. I appreciate your input.

Josh shakes his hand before he walks off. Then, Josh answers his phone.

JOSH
Hey, how was Philly?

DONNA [VO]
Pretty good.

Donna is walking down one of the aisles of the plane, talking to Josh.

DONNA

CUT TO: EXT. - CAFE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Who was at the photo op?

As Donna answers, Josh turns and sees [men] talking.

DONNA [VO]
AP, Reuters, the Times, Le Monde... We figure it's probably front page of
the Philadelphia Inquirer. Any way you'd like me to spin it?

CUT TO: INT. - SANTOS PLANE - CONTINUOUS

DONNA [cont.]
"Acts like a man, eats like a man"?

JOSH [VO]
Yeah, I got to go.

Donna hangs up.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Josh hangs up his phone and shakes hands with Senator George Montgomery,
who has walked over from the group of men who were talking.

SENATOR GEORGE MONTGOMERY
Josh.

JOSH
Senator Montgomery.

MONTGOMERY
Great news about Illinois.

JOSH
Absolutely. Nice to have it in play.

MONTGOMERY
Shame we didn't start there earlier.

JOSH
Well, we had some other places we had to be.

MONTGOMERY
At 21 electoral votes, I'd have thought it'd be a little higher on the
priority list.

JOSH
We're only up by six in New York. Any state we're losing by ten doesn't get
a lot of attention.

MONTGOMERY
So long as we start investing there now.

JOSH
There's no doubt.

MONTGOMERY
Listen, I heard there's a rumor you're pulling money out of Iowa.

JOSH
We're thinking about pulling money out of a lot of places.

MONTGOMERY
As goes Iowa, so goes the Midwest. I'd cut back in Philadelphia. See you at
the wedding, Josh.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

Montgomery walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - WILL'S OFFICE - DAY

Will is sitting at his desk when Kate walks in holding one of the seating
charts up and making some marks on it.

WILL
You done?

KATE
Just about. You want to take a look?

WILL
Sure.

She lays it down on his desk.

WILL
Canadian Prime Minister won't mind being stuck in the corner?

KATE
It's for the best: he's a little grabby.

WILL
Really?

KATE
He brings a whole new meaning to "Oh, Canada."

WILL
K.H. plus one?

KATE
That's me. The President wanted someone from the NSC to go.

WILL
Smooth over any international incidents.

KATE
Prevent, more like.

WILL
Sure.

KATE
You're not going?

WILL
I wasn't invited. I was concerned it might have something to do with my
encounter with the happy couple last weekend, but I hear it's a small affair.

She smiles.

WILL
Is there something on my...?

KATE
Do you own a tux?

WILL
Excuse me?

KATE
I mean, I was just going to go stag, but... if you're not busy later... don't
have anything to do...

CUT TO: INT. - MEETING ROOM - SANTOS HQ - DAY

Leo is sitting at the table, dressed in his tux for the wedding. Santos
comes in buttoning his sleeve and he has yet to tie his bowtie.

LEO
You clean up nice.

SANTOS
Don't start. I already got it from Helen.

LEO
Philadelphia cheese steak; it's a political rite of passage.

SANTOS
Yeah, wait till you see the pictures.

LEO
It's only going to endear you to the Eagles fans in Philly and South Jersey.

SANTOS
I had a little chat with Baker.

LEO
How's the governor?

SANTOS
He's concerned. He's concerned about the campaign: why we weren't in Illinois,
why we're not spending more in Pennsylvania.

LEO
Monday morning quarterbacking: it's a favorite pastime in Philadelphia.

SANTOS
He's not the only one that's concerned. I've gotten calls.

LEO
Josh?

Santos gives a half-hearted nod in the affirmative.

LEO
We're six weeks out, still seven points down; vultures are going to swarm.

SANTOS
I just want to make sure they're not swarming for a reason.

LEO
No one else I'd rather have running this campaign.

Bram walks in.

BRAM
Congressman. You wanted to screen the new Texas ad buy?

SANTOS
Yeah. See you down there in ten?

LEO
Yeah.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - WAR ROOM - SANTOS HQ - DAY

Josh is going over one of the electoral map boards. Lou comes in.

LOU
Josh?

JOSH
You think we should cut the media buy in Missouri?

LOU
Aren't you supposed to be at the wedding?

JOSH
Missouri or maybe New York.

LOU
To pay for Illinois?

JOSH
We should take a harder look at Michigan.

LOU
I just called the media team to pull the money out of Wisconsin.

JOSH
Yeah, uh, we're going to hold off on that.

Edie walks in.

EDIE
Josh, your car's ready.

JOSH
I'll call you after the wedding.

He walks out.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet and Vic are seated across from each other. Bartlet is speaking.

BARTLET
I know you think this is probably old-fashioned, but, frankly, it's much
more humane than it used to be. Abbey's father made me take a six-hour hike
with him through the woods outside Mt. Pelier in the dead of winter. At
least it felt like six hours. Of course I was still a grad student then,
whereas you're almost a tenured professor. Isn't that right?

VIC
Uh, yes. At least, the dean suggested... I mean, in the next few years...

BARTLET
Good, good. Because before you know it, you'll have a house and kids.

Debbie knocks.

BARTLET
Yeah.

She comes in.

DEBBIE
Sir, the guests are starting to arrive.

BARTLET
Yeah.

DEBBIE
You should be heading back to the Residence to change. You don't want to be
late to the cocktail hour you're hosting.

BARTLET
Thank you, Debbie.

She leaves.

BARTLET
Well, thanks for dropping by.

They stand.

VIC
Sir, was there something that you wanted to discuss?

BARTLET
No, no. I just thought... you know, when you have a daughter, you just like
to know... you really want to know whether... Ah, hell. Just tell me you
decided to marry her before you got her pregnant.

VIC
11 months, two weeks and three days.

BARTLET
Excuse me?

VIC
That's when I decided to marry her: a year ago, on our third date.

BARTLET
What was the matter with the first two?

Vic looks unsure. Bartlet reaches out and they shake hands.

BARTLET
I'll see you at the end of the aisle.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Josh walks into the White House. He is on his cell phone.

JOSH
Yeah, we're going to need the new numbers from Michigan too. ... Yeah. Thanks,
Otto.

He hangs up. He sees Santos talking with Montgomery as C.J. and Barry Goodwin,
Chairman of the DNC, walk up.

BARRY GOODWIN
Ah, Josh. He's just a big blowhard.

JOSH
C.J., Mr. Chairman.

GOODWIN
Former Chairman, Josh.

C.J.
Wishful thinking, maybe.

He shakes hands with Goodwin and kisses C.J. on the cheek.

GOODWIN
Oh, no. Those of us on the sidelines can see what a great job he's doing.

JOSH
I appreciate that, sir.

GOODWIN
Now, if we can just get this one to run for something. Good to see you, Josh.

JOSH
You too, sir.

GOODWIN
Keep up the good work.

JOSH
I appreciate it.

They shake hands and Goodwin walks off.

C.J.
Barry Goodwin running the party; those were the days, huh?

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
You guys must be excited.

JOSH
Hmm?

C.J.
Illinois.

JOSH
Yeah. Hopefully we can afford it.

They start walking.

C.J.
Pinching pennies?

JOSH
Pretty much.

C.J.
You're up a bit in Washington. Can you take some money out of Seattle?

JOSH
We're pulling out of Washington.

C.J.
Wow! Things that tight?

JOSH
Welcome to my world.

C.J.'s beeper goes off. She pulls out her purse and looks at the beeper.

JOSH
Is that Kazakhstan?

C.J.
Probably; you want to trade?

She pulls out a bingo card.

C.J.
Here. Take your mind off things.

JOSH
Dignitary Bingo?

C.J.
I've already got four across. Find the Mexican President and you're home.

As C.J. walks off, Josh looks and sees Santos and Leo talking with Montgomery
and Goodwin.

CUT TO: INT. - BASEMENT HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

C.J. is coming down a set of stairs when she sees Kate coming from the
other direction.

C.J.
You look nice.

KATE
Nothing says "International Crisis" like a pair of black stilettos.

C.J.
You know what's going on?

KATE
I just got paged.

C.J.
Yeah. You really look nice.

KATE
Ok, now I'm starting to think you're hitting on me.

C.J.
No, I'm serious. The makeup, the hair...

KATE
I'm trying to impress.

C.J.
Who's the guy?

KATE
What makes you think there's a guy?

C.J.
The necklace, the neckline, the earrings, the back...

KATE
Okay, okay. I have a date.

C.J.
Really?

KATE
I think you'd call it a date. I kind of invited Will to the wedding.

C.J. looks stunned.

KATE
Dark hair, glasses, just got a big promotion?

C.J.
Will Bailey?

KATE
Yeah, we were talking and...

C.J.
You asked Will on a date?

KATE
Technically I just invited him to the wedding.

C.J.
Will Bailey?!

KATE
Yeah, I'm gonna...

They walk into the Situation Room.

C.J.
What have we got Miles, other than the sensation that we've all suddenly
landed in a British drawing room farce.

HUTCHINSON
There's been an incident in Kazakhstan. The protestors at Alma Ata turned
violent and Tarimov sent in riot police.

KATE
Any casualties?

HUTCHINSON
Our people on the ground are saying it could be up to 200, many of them
ethnic Chinese.

C.J.
The Russian convoys...

HUTCHINSON
...have crossed the border. We expect the Chinese to start mobilizing
any minute.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Bartlet and Debbie are walking and talking. Debbie is talking about her
Dignitary Bingo card.

DEBBIE
Minority Leader, Postmaster General... is that the Swiss Ambassador over there?

BARTLET
Is this a test?

She shows him the card.

DEBBIE
Dignitary Bingo, ten bucks a sheet; are you in?

BARTLET
Aren't you supposed to be hurrying me someplace?

DEBBIE
Photo op with Congressman Santos and then bridal party photo at 4:00.

BARTLET
So I've got half an hour?

DEBBIE
Maybe. Is that the Swiss Ambassador or not?

BARTLET
How much you got riding on this?

DEBBIE
50 bucks.

BARTLET
It's the Duke of Edinburgh.

DEBBIE
Ah, Duke of Edinburgh.

She writes something down on her card as Bartlet breaks off for the photo
op with Santos.

BARTLET
Congressman.

They shake hands.

SANTOS
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Leo. Welcome.

He and Leo shake hands.

BARTLET
I hear they like you in Illinois.

SANTOS
Apparently I'm growing on them.

BARTLET
Well, after your performance in those debates, I'm not surprised.

LEO
Wasn't he something?

SANTOS
You think that's impressive, you ought to see me do cheese steak.

LEO
Senator Montgomery wanted a word.

SANTOS
That's my cue.

BARTLET
Find me later. We'll talk about Cabinet travel and ways we can be helpful
in the home stretch.

SANTOS
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Good luck.

Santos walks off.

BARTLET
Things are looking up, bub.

LEO
We're making some headway.

BARTLET
Mm-hmm. You know if you win this damn thing, you're stuck working here
another four years.

LEO
I like to think of the Vice Presidency as more of an emeritus position.

BARTLET
Sure.

LEO
How's everything on this end?

BARTLET
Well, Russia and China are doing there little Sharks-and-Jets routine in
Central Asia and Abbey's got an understudy for me.

LEO
Seriously?

BARTLET
Yeah. Uncle Norman's on call.

LEO
Ouch.

BARTLET
I've been getting some calls about Josh.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
Triplehorn, Nayak, Stackhouse, Montgomery.

LEO
We're losing six weeks out, people get antsy.

BARTLET
Sure. It's always like that around this time.

LEO
Absolutely. Who'd they want to replace me?

BARTLET
Okay, so maybe not always.

Debbie walks up.

DEBBIE
Okay, enough gossiping, ladies.

LEO
Debbie, you look lovely as always.

DEBBIE
You've got 20 minutes. I assume you'll want to say hello to the Duke of
Edinburgh.

LEO
That's not the Duke of Edinburgh.

BARTLET
Catch you later.

He walks over to where Abbey is waiting for him.

BARTLET
Hey. I thought the wedding photos weren't until 4:00.

ABBEY
We got a little ahead of the game so I thought you might want to get in
that dance.

BARTLET
Have I mentioned this "Mother-of-the-bride" thing agrees with you.

ABBEY
When Liz got married, you said I didn't look old enough to be the mother of
the bride.

BARTLET
You didn't.

ABBEY
I do now?

BARTLET
I didn't say that.

ABBEY
What did you say?

BARTLET
Is there anyway out of this for me?

ABBEY
Probably not.

C.J. walks up.

C.J.
Mr. President. The Chinese troops have started moving into Kazakhstan. We've
got a translator in the Oval, we're getting the Premier on the line now.

ABBEY
It's okay. We'll do the photos after.

He walks towards the door to the Oval.

ABBEY
Jed. The service starts at 5:00.

BARTLET
Yeah.

He goes in and Abbey walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Josh is sitting on the stairs. Donna walks up to him carrying a plate of food.

DONNA
Fried wonton?

JOSH
Hey.

She sits next to him.

DONNA
Really, they're pretty good.

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
They're out of champagne, though. The First Lady just gave me 20 bucks and
told me to pick up a bottle of Cold Duck.

Josh doesn't say anything.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
I'm sorry. Have you seen Leo?

DONNA
I'm bored. I'm an attractive woman waiting to be entertained.

JOSH
He was just with the President. I'm sure he's still...

DONNA
I just saw him headed toward the East Room.

Josh gets up to walk away.

DONNA
He was with the Congressman and Barry Goodwin and Senator Montgomery. It looked
pretty intense. [pause] Illinois? [pause] I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

Josh walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - EAST ROOM - DAY

Santos, Leo, Montgomery and Goodwin are talking.

MONTGOMERY
Leo, I'm all for allegiance, but loyalty for loyalty's sake is ridiculous.

LEO
Sure...

MONTGOMERY
Josh got it wrong in Illinois.

LEO
Well, sure, with the benefit of hindsight.

MONTGOMERY
21 electoral votes.

LEO
I didn't see you calling for a major effort in Illinois.

SANTOS
Barry?

GOODWIN
Look, I have never seen an electoral map as inside-out as this one. And as for
Illinois, we were ten points down. Chicago's one of the most expensive media
markets in the country. Now, spending money there would have meant sacrificing
Iowa, maybe Missouri, and possibly slimming our ad-buy in Wisconsin, but...

SANTOS
It's cost us.

GOODWIN
Yes, it has. Polls move money as much as money moves polls. If you had been
in Illinois you'd have gotten this bump sooner, possibly seen a boost in
fundraising, and maybe you wouldn't be pulling out of so many states now.

MONTGOMERY
Josh Lyman's done a terrific job, but Congressman, I'm not sure he can see
you through to the finish line.

SANTOS
Who can?

GOODWIN
Only one guy I'd want running a campaign this tough and that's the guy
standing next to you.

Leo smiles as if they are joking. Santos looks at him and Leo realizes they
are not joking. The smile fades from his face.

FADE OUT.

Abbey and Ellie are waiting.

ABBEY
You should sit down.

ELLIE
It'll wrinkle. [pause] You know, we considered going to Las Vegas.

ABBEY
Sounds pretty good about now, huh?

There is a knock at the door.

ELLIE
Come in.

Will comes in.

WILL
Uh, hi.

ABBEY
Hello.

WILL
C.J. asked me to tell you that they started circulating additional refreshments
downstairs, in case you were worried.

ABBEY
Any idea when the President might be joining us?

WILL
I'm afraid not.

There is an awkward silence between Ellie and Will.

WILL
Well, I should, uh... get back. Congratulations.

He leaves and closes the door.

ELLIE
Why is Will Bailey wearing a tux?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is at his desk, on the phone. There is a translator sitting beside
Bartlet's desk, and he is on the phone as well. Kate, C.J., Hutchinson and
some generals are also in the room. Debbie is standing behind Bartlet holding
a marker and a pad of sticky notes.

TRANSLATOR
Mr. President, we can not pull back.

Debbie writes something on a piece of paper and sticks the paper on the desk
in front of Bartlet. It says "5:06."

BARTLET
Lian, this doesn't make any sense. The Russians supply you with the oil they
take out of Kazakhstan.

We hear the Premier talking and the translator begins to speak.

TRANSLATOR
At a premium, some of which goes to the owners of the pipelines; American
companies, I believe.

BARTLET
We're not supporting the Russians.

TRANSLATOR
Yet you're condoning their attempt to annex half of Central Asia.

BARTLET
Lian, I'm not condoning anything. I am trying to stop two nuclear powers
from going to war over oil!

TRANSLATOR
Oil? Mr. President, this is not about oil. It is about the brutal suppression
of a Democratic movement; a movement that includes many ethnic Chinese -
our brothers and sisters. You, of all people, should understand our concern.

CUT TO: INT. - EAST ROOM - DAY

Several people are milling about. Santos, Leo, Montgomery and Goodwin are
talking.

MONTGOMERY
Look, you've only got one more hour of campaigning left anyway.

GOODWIN
He's right. Once you finish the Vice Presidential debates, you're almost done.

LEO
Tell that to my schedulers.

MONTGOMERY
Due respect, you're not exactly a force on the campaign trail.

GOODWIN
Josh is going to have to move his war room to the Congressman's plane in
the next few weeks anyway. You guys start campaigning together, you can work
out of there.

MONTGOMERY
It might even play better for the crowds.

LEO
We'd cover half the ground.

MONTGOMERY
You'd get a boost from the joint appearances.

GOODWIN
The point is, this campaign should be making the best use of its political
assets.

LEO
We are... with me on the trail and Josh Lyman running things at headquarters.

GOODWIN
Congressman?

SANTOS
I appreciate your thoughts, gentlemen.

GOODWIN
Right.

MONTGOMERY
Thank you, Congressman.

They all shake hands. Goodwin and Montgomery walk off.

LEO
We should find Josh and go over the morning meetings.

SANTOS
Uh-huh. Leo? Should Josh be running this campaign?

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Abbey is walking through the hallway. She walks into the lobby and sees Leo.

ABBEY
Hey, stranger.

LEO
Abbey.

ABBEY
Nice speech in Des Moines.

LEO
Can you believe this dog and pony show they've got me in?

ABBEY
You getting any sleep?

LEO
And eating my vegetables.

ABBEY
Good.

LEO
How's Ellie?

ABBEY
Still standing.

LEO
That's good.

ABBEY
Not really. The dress... it wrinkles.

LEO
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

ABBEY
You think?

LEO
Miracles happen.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet and Co. are still in the room. Bartlet has by now taken his jacket off.

BARTLET
Lian, I need your men to stop advancing. If you'll just hold your position...

TRANSLATOR
I'm not sure what that will accomplish.

BARTLET
Let me at least talk to the Russians. Try to convince them to push President
Tarimov to reschedule elections.

Debbie puts another sticky note down on the desk. This one says "5:46."

TRANSLATOR
It was the Russians who put Tarimov in power in the first place. For years,
this has been how the Russians have been operating...

BARTLET
Lian.

TRANSLATOR [cont.]
... and given their history, it seems clear to me...

BARTLET
Lian.

TRANSLATOR [cont.]
... that the only way to stop their continued aggression...

Bartlet slams his fist on the desk and stands.

BARTLET
Damn it, Lian, will you shut up already!

The translator says nothing, indicating that Lian is silent as well.

BARTLET
Is your daughter married?

TRANSLATOR
Excuse me, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Your daughter, the one I met when we were in Beijing, is she married?

TRANSLATOR
Yes. She was married two years ago, last spring.

BARTLET
Then you will understand me when I tell you that my daughter's wedding is this
afternoon and that she has been waiting for 46 minutes for me to give her away
because I can't put down this damned phone until you tell me that you're not
going to start World War III today! Now, for the love of God, Lian, will you
give me just one half hour so I can go and walk my little girl down the aisle?

There is silence for a moment or two. Then we hear Lian speak.

TRANSLATOR
Mr. President, we can continue this discussion in one hour.

BARTLET
And your troops will hold their position until then?

TRANSLATOR
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you, Lian.

He hangs up. Debbie gets his jacket and helps him put it on.

BARTLET
You've got one hour.

He and Debbie leave.

CUT TO: EXT. - PORTICO - DAY

Josh is standing at the balcony as Leo walks up.

JOSH
Is the wedding starting?

LEO
Not yet.

JOSH
How's Senator Montgomery?

LEO
Full of hot air, as usual.

JOSH
Yeah? Who's he want to replace me.

LEO
Josh.

JOSH
Who is it?

LEO
No one wants to replace you.

JOSH
It's Goodwin too, isn't it? Son of a bitch. He was just shaking my... So,
who do they want? Is it Pipeman? Bloom? I mean, the guy's practically tone
deaf when it comes to message politics, but I'm sure he'd be good.

LEO
Josh.

JOSH
You could get Simons or Sharp. Maybe you should just promote Lou. It's not
like any of the others have run a Presidential.

There is a silence and Josh realizes who they wanted.

JOSH
They want you. It's you, isn't it? Hell, that's who I'd want. You would have
known. You would have been in Illinois months ago, right?

LEO
Stop it!

JOSH
Right? You would have figured it out. Where would you have gotten the
dough? Come on tell me, where would you have gotten the money?

LEO
I wouldn't have gotten the money because I would have been in Illinois. The
polls there looked as bad as when we were running against Eisenhower. I would
have made the same decision as you. And that is exactly what I told Barry
Goodwin and George Montgomery. Look, these are tough calls. It's impossible
to know how they're going to turn out. What's important is how you respond
when you get it wrong, how you react, what your next move is.

Josh pulls out the map he was looking at earlier.

JOSH
I don't know what my next move is. I've been staring at this damn map all
day. I still haven't got a clue. Iowa's vulnerable. I don't know what I was
thinking in Wisconsin. We can't take a dime out of Ohio, Florida, Texas... I
don't know where to start. They're right: you should take over.

LEO
You're all trying to kill me.

They hear music begin to play.

LEO
The wedding's about to start. Give me the map. Come on, we'll talk about it
on the way.

He takes the map and they begin to walk inside.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - DAY

Bartlet walks in. Abbey and Ellie are still waiting.

ABBEY
You made it.

Ellie looks at Bartlet and smiles.

BARTLET
Honey, you look...

ELLIE
Dad?

BARTLET
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

ELLIE
It's okay, Dad, really. You wanted a White House wedding.

He holds out his arm.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Santos is on the phone.

SANTOS
All of that is being taken into consideration. ... Well, I thank you for
your support. ... Thank you so much.

Leo and Josh walk in as Santos hangs up.

LEO
I'll meet you in there.

Josh walks away.

SANTOS
How'd it go?

LEO
Fine.

SANTOS
You taking over?

LEO
No.

SANTOS
Leo, I thought we...

LEO
Josh is going to make a lot of strategic decisions over the next few
weeks. He's going to sweat them like life and death. And they'll be important,
sure, which is why you and me are going to be in on every one of them. But
they're meaningless compared to the decision the voters are going to have
to make just by listening to you and trying to see if they can connect
with the idea of Matt Santos as President. And Josh has nothing to do with
that. Goodwin's right: Josh has taken you as far as he can. The rest is up
to you.

CUT TO: INT. - STAIRWELL - DAY

Bartlet is walking Ellie down the stairs. They come into the foyer outside
the East Room where the wedding procession of bridesmaids and flower girls
has begun. They stop, waiting till time for Ellie to walk.

ELLIE
You okay, Dad?

BARTLET
You know, one time during my first term in Congress we went on a Congressional
delegation to East Germany. You probably don't remember, you couldn't
have been more than four or five. But anyway, we got to East Berlin and we
were waiting online with our passports at Checkpoint Charlie when all of a
sudden you bolted out into the no-man's land between the two guard posts and
everything stopped. The MPs just froze and your mother and I were scared to
death, but not you. You just calmly looked up at one of the soldiers on the
wall and you waved and the soldier waved back. And then...

He falters. Ellie picks up the story.

ELLIE
And then all the soldiers were waving at each other. I remember, Dad.

He helps her pull her veil down over her face.

ELLIE
Take my arm.

They begin their walk and we see the audience rise.
