TEASER

FADE IN: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
      5:00 AM
      21 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION

Several Santos staffers are on computers and phones getting new polling
information.

RONNA
Arizona, up by four; Nevada, up by three; Virginia, up by four.

ANNABETH
California?

RONNA
Up by six.

ANNABETH
I have seven.

DONNA
Who's that?

ANNABETH
Gallup.

DONNA
Really?

ANNABETH
I'm reading it right off the paper.

DONNA
Oh, my God.

RONNA
Is it up?

OTTO
Nope.

ANNABETH
Check again.

OTTO
I'm hitting refresh once every 12 seconds.

ANNABETH
Sometimes when you keep pressing the button it won't load.

RONNA
She's right.

DONNA
You may have to go to another page and then come back to this one.

BRAM
How's it coming?

OTTO
I've got three women trying to tell me how to use the New York Time's website.

BRAM
It's pretty straight-forward. You need some help?

OTTO
I think I've got it under control.

RONNA
Up four in Louisiana, tied in Arkansas.

ANNABETH
Tied in North Carolina, South Carolina.

DONNA
South Carolina?!

OTTO
It's up, it's up, it's up. The New York Times tracking poll... first national
sample since the accident at the San Andreo nuclear facility in Southern
California, blah, blah, blah... in this three-day spread, polling 1400 likely
voters, Senator Vinick dropped...

He taps the mouse a few times.

OTTO
Damn it! The screen froze!

RONNA
Oh, for God's sake!

ANNABETH
I've got it over here, you guys.

They all rush over to Annabeth's computer. They all begin to smile at what
they see.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - HOTEL - NIGHT

Donna and Bram run out into the hallway and start knocking on doors to wake
people up to tell them the news. They run down the hall, knocking on every
door along the way. Donna comes to a door and stops. She knocks but there
is no answer. She knocks again. We hear Josh moving around on the other side.

JOSH
Yeah, yeah.

He opens the door, looking very groggy. Donna walks past him into the room.

DONNA
State-by-states are out. We're tied in South Carolina, Arkansas, and
California.

JOSH
California?

DONNA
We've pulled ahead in Arizona, Nevada, Virginia. We got the new national
tracking polls...

JOSH
The Times?

DONNA
It's 44-44. We're tied

JOSH
We're tied?

DONNA
Nationally.

JOSH
Holy Mother of God, we caught him!

DONNA
Yes.

He suddenly seems to snap out of the drowsiness.

JOSH [cont.]
We caught him!

He grabs Donna and lands a kiss right on her. They pull away, still
holding each other, contemplating. They come in again and this time for
much longer. We pan around as they continue to kiss very passionately. We
pan out to the hallway where we see the door close while Josh and Donna are
still kissing. We then see Santos coming down the hall toward Josh's room,
and he is very excited.

SANTOS
Josh?! Where's Josh?

He knocks on Josh door and pushes it open. Josh and Donna are no longer
kissing but they still look ecstatic.

SANTOS
Are they messing with me?

Josh shakes his head and Santos hugs him in the tumult. We pan back to the
hall where we see everybody hugging and exclaiming at the news.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.
END TEASER.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Bruno and Sheila are talking with Vinick.

BRUNO
Our lead narrowed Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia; we're neck-and-neck in the
Carolinas and they pulled ahead of us in Arizona and Virginia.

SHEILA
The Times put it at 44-44.

VINICK
California?

SHEILA
Tied.

VINICK
Nine points ahead in California a week ago. Now we're tied. Now we're tied.

BRUNO
The good news is most of the votes we lost are showing up undecided. They
are not going for Santos yet.

VINICK
12% undecided this late in the campaign.

SHEILA
You have local press downstairs.

BRUNO
No comments on the nuclear accident in California.

VINICK
Yeah.

BRUNO
It was a national tragedy. You're not going to talk about it in a political
context.

SHEILA
You are concentrated on meeting voters, talking about the issues.

BRUNO
Mainly tax cuts and more tax cuts.

Vinick sneezes very loudly.

SHEILA
Are you okay?

VINICK
Yeah, I'm fine.

SHEILA
The Kazakhstan situation is heating up. You can always pivot to that if you
need to...

VINICK
I need 30 seconds to myself, okay?

He walks off.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

C.J. and Kate are in the room with Hutchinson, Barrow, and several generals.

C.J.
Tied, nationally.

KATE
Who'd have thunk it?

BARROW
Vinick must be weeping in his beer.

Bartlet walks in. Everyone stands.

BARTLET
Have we talked to the Russians?

C.J.
They're sticking with their story: the election wasn't rigged; Tarimov is
the legitimate President of Kazakhstan. Russian troops have crossed the
border to provide stability to the new government.

Bartlet sits, as does everyone else.

KATE
China says they've also gone in for stabilization purposes.

BARTLET
How about NATO?

BARROW
Everyone likes the idea of a peacekeeping force, but nobody wants to be in one.

BARTLET
I can't imagine why not.

C.J.
The UN's not going to get involved. China and Russia can both veto in the
Security Council.

HUTCHINSON
So it's just us.

BARTLET
Which looks like what?

HUTCHINSON
Russia's moving in from the northwest, China from the east. We need to send
enough troops to create a human buffer zone between the two advancing armies.

BARTLET
How far apart are they?

KATE
About 600 miles, but not for long.

BARTLET
I want to see invasion plans as soon as possible.

HUTCHINSON
We wouldn't think of it as an invasion, sir. We'd call it an intervention.

BARTLET
Show me a plan that doesn't look like an invasion, I'll call it whatever
your want.

He walks toward his desk as the meeting disbands. Kate and C.J. walk into
C.J.'s office.

C.J.
Keep the NATO ball in the air. I don't want anyone getting the impression
we're writing them off.

KATE
I'll stay on it with State.

C.J.
Have Ted Barrow put together a NATO briefing for next week.

KATE
We don't know where we're going quite yet.

C.J.
Hopefully we'll know next week.

Kate walks off. She meets Will along the way.

WILL
Hi.

KATE
Hi.

WILL
I have a thing of yours.

KATE
My Pyongyang book, good. I tore up my whole office looking for it.

WILL
It's not that.

KATE
Really?

WILL
Really.

KATE
It's in a blue binder. It may not be...

WILL
Nothing in a blue binder.

KATE
Are you sure? I mean, picking it out...

WILL
It's a bra.

KATE
Oh, okay.

WILL
I put it in a padded envelope, which seemed appropriate.

KATE
Really?

WILL
You want it now?

KATE
No! No. Yes? [pause] It's in your office?

WILL
It is.

KATE
You keep it.

WILL
Permanently?

KATE
Mail it to me. Your home address is my home address.

WILL
You don't think that's a little complicated?

KATE
It is, isn't it?

WILL
I'll hang on to it until we...

KATE
Okay.

WILL
We'll get better at this.

They separate.

KATE
One can only hope.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL - DAY

Santos and his staff are getting ready to head out.

JOSH
Cancel everything here after the morning rally. We've got to get on the
ground in the battle states. Vinick's going to have to head south to get
his lead back in Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Carolinas.

They get into the elevator and the doors close.

CUT TO: INT. - KITCHEN - HOTEL - DAY

Santos, Leo, Josh and all the others are walking through the kitchen to get
to the car.

LEO
Has he even been down South since the primaries?

JOSH
Nope. While he flails around down there, we'll have all the swing states
to ourselves.

ANNABETH
Nuclear power plants in every one of those swing states.

DONNA
Local news crews will be all over us.

RONNA
Free media!

SANTOS
Straight from heaven.

LEO
San Andreo created a lot of undecideds. We've got to get them off the fence.

JOSH
Yeah, a lot of them were Dems who didn't know you and were satisfied voting
for a moderate Republican.

SANTOS
Well, time for them to come home to the Party.

LEO
They want to hear about deficit reduction, they want to hear you're gonna
put more cops on the streets.

ANNABETH
We need to focus on the fact that you were fighting nuclear power 15 years
ago. You're the forward-thinking candidate with a nuance vision.

LEO
The kind of vision a President needs to handle complicated international
situations like this mess in Kazakhstan.

JOSH
He had the vision to predict problems with nuclear power, he has the vision
to find solutions for our future.

ANNABETH
Yeah.

JOSH
Who's writing?

They get into yet another elevator and the doors again close.

CUT TO: INT. - BASEMENT - DAY

The Santos staff is still walking.

LEO
The Santos Education Plan is now the 21st Century Education Plan.

JOSH
The 21st Century Health Plan.

SANTOS
Let's not forget energy.

JOSH
The 21st Century Energy Plan. He's about the future, Vinick's about the past.

RONNA
Great.

JOSH
I'll have Joey test some language, but that's the direction.

BRAM
I'm coordinating with Advance. Which state should we hit first?

JOSH
Well, that's easy.

SANTOS
California.

JOSH
Yeah.

They start getting into the cars to leave and Josh gets into one and sits
next to Donna. There is a bit of awkwardness about the moment.

JOSH
Hi.

DONNA
Hi.

CUT TO: INT. - VINICK PLANE - DAY

Vinick, Sheila, and his staff are walking.

SHEILA
Drink this.

VINICK
I don't want it.

SHEILA
I didn't ask you if you wanted it.

VINICK
It looks like Hawaiian Punch, it smells disgusting, and I'm not getting
sick. Bob?

BOB
We lost these people because of the nuclear accident. Give them time to realize
you didn't meltdown the thing by yourself, they'll come back on their own.

BRUNO
A cycle like that takes a month, which we don't have.

SULLIVAN
The base.

SHEILA
Governor...

SULLIVAN
We have had a good time always running to the center, but the party's
over. You're a Republican. You need to start talking to the Republican
conservative base.

BRUNO
Nail him to a cross; he can stump for votes on the Via Dolorosa.

SULLIVAN
I am the only person talking to values voters.

BRUNO
And you are doing a fantastic job.

SULLIVAN
They're not voting for me, and they know it. He needs to spend more time in
the southern states to make sure we don't lose them.

BRUNO
The undecideds are moderates. They're not bible thumpers. He's got to speak
to their issues.

SULLIVAN
What's he going to do? Suddenly pull the Arnold Vinick Health Plan out of
his tailpipe?

VINICK
Would that qualify as a miracle? They like the miracles.

SULLIVAN
It would look like desperation.

BOB
We need an ad blitz - negative.

SULLIVAN
That's not a bad idea.

BRUNO
It is, actually.

SULLIVAN
What we need to do is curb Santos' momentum - keep these folks undecided
long enough for this nuclear mess to fade.

SHEILA
It's not going to fade. He's going to run thousands of spots on your
long-standing love affair with nuclear power.

BOB
Which is why we need something to hit back with; I'm not talking a smear
campaign, just some focus on the thousands of times Santos has voted to
increase spending.

BRUNO
It'll drive up our negatives just as much as it does his. He'll look like
a mudslinging desperate hatchet.

BOB
So what?

BRUNO
Is that an existential question?

BOB
Last week Vinick was the voice of experience. Now suddenly, Santos is a wise,
pressing visionary and the Senator looks like...

VINICK
A foolish old man?

BOB
I'm sorry, sir. I just...

VINICK
No, go ahead. I love it.

BRUNO
We're assuming it can't get worse. Let me tell you something: it can.

VINICK
We go negative, they're going to trot out every bad call I ever made. They're
going to plaster them all over the air waves.

BRUNO
Yeah.

VINICK
It's going to come back and bite us in the ass.

BRUNO
Yeah. I'm agreeing with you.

VINICK
You are? All right.

SHEILA
We need to stay the course. The Senator speaks to the center, we pep around
a little more on health care and education; Sullivan speaks locally to the
right flank.

VINICK
He's going to talk about health care too?

SHEILA
No. He's going to be doing what he's been doing - family values, apple pie.

SULLIVAN
So you're sticking with the 50-state strategy?

SHEILA
No.

SULLIVAN
We can't win 50 states anymore.

SHEILA
I'm aware of that. It's still the best strategy we have. We'll do a swing
through the South, shore up our numbers there. But he's not appending his
message this late in the campaign.

Someone hands Sheila a note.

SHEILA
You've got Pensey and Carrolton.

VINICK
If I start going after the base now I'll look like an idiot.

SHEILA
The Governor's going after the base. You've just got to make nice with Pensey
and Carrolton.

Vinick gets up and leaves.

SULLIVAN
You want me to shape this?

BRUNO
We've got time before your 11:00. Let's get into it now.

Sullivan sighs.

BRUNO
Unless you want to talk about it alone, in which case you could discuss it
over lunch.

Sullivan gets up and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - SIT ROOM - DAY

Bartlet is talking with the National Security Team. General Wendell is
speaking.

WENDELL
Our base in Ayaguf has 9,000 marines on the ground. We're proposing sending
in an additional 90,000 ground troops for control and stabilization.

BARTLET
They'll require support units?

WENDELL
Certainly.

BARTLET
How many?

KATE
Another 40,000.

WENDELL
We'd come up from the south, creating a zone of neutrality separating the
Russian-controlled northwest and the Chinese-controlled east. The mountains
here on the edge of Lake Balkash create a natural barrier. Our hope is that
the Chinese won't push past them.

C.J.
It'll take weeks to prep an intervention this size.

HUTCHINSON
Eight, probably.

C.J.
We don't have that kind of time.

WENDELL
We'll start an early deployment of 12,000 troops. The rest will follow
as ready.

BARTLET
Coming from where?

WENDELL
We'd pull the first armored division from Vispaden.

BARTLET
And we get them there how?

HUTCHINSON
Send them through the Trans-low hub to gather munitions and equipment then
deploy on C-17s.

WENDELL
Or we could airlift them straight from Vispaden on C-130s.

HUTCHINSON
If you want the armored division to bring their tanks we're going to have
to go with the C-17s.

BARTLET
What will they wear?

Several people turn at him as though this is a silly question to ask.

HUTCHINSON
I think green and brown are still the favorites.

Bartlet answers as if he is a little mad at this sarcastic remark.

BARTLET
What kind of outerwear?

Hutchinson again answers in a semi-sarcastic manner.

HUTCHINSON
I haven't seen any type of prototype recently...

BARTLET
We're talking about sending 150,000 Americans to the 50th Parallel in
November. It starts snowing in Astana in August, and doesn't stop until
June. As opposed to the Russians who do this a lot. Americans haven't fought a
war in the cold in quite some time. I would like to know what kind of coats
you plan to put on our troops.

WENDELL
We'll look into it, sir.

BARTLET
Do that and come back.

They get up and leave, leaving Bartlet and C.J. sitting.

C.J.
SanCom's suggesting a no-fly in Kazakhstan - symbolic buffer between the
two armies until we can get rapid deployment under way.

BARTLET
Yeah. [pause] 150,000 troops.

C.J.
We're not talking about a drive-by, either. If we go in, we could be there
for years.

BARTLET
I need to talk to the candidates.

He stands and leaves. C.J. stands when he does, and then sits again when he
is gone.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. - CAMPAIGN SITE - DAY

Josh, Donna, and Ronna are walking and talking. Santos can be heard in
the background.

RONNA
Rally in San Diego as soon as we arrive, visits to two of the shelters
housing evacuees from San Andreo.

DONNA
Is he talking about the accident?

JOSH
Nothing about the accident, nothing about nuclear power; he's just sharing
some ideas about health care and education with a couple of cooling towers
in the background.

BRAM
You've got a lot of new friends suddenly.

JOSH
Who?

BRAM
Governor Watley, Governor Stockwell, Secretary of Energy, Treasury Secretary,
Senator Pallor...

JOSH
How many times did I call Stockwell and Pallor?

BRAM
A lot.

DONNA
That was before we were coattails.

JOSH
Well, better late than never. Put them on the schedule. Why are you looking
at me like that?

BRAM
Bono called.

RONNA
Bono?!

DONNA
Really?!

BRAM
Yeah. He's in New York this weekend. He wants to have dinner with the
Congressman.

DONNA
Do it!

BRAM
We're not in New York this week.

RONNA
Change the schedule!

DONNA
Bono wants to meet him?

RONNA
Does he want to perform at a rally?

BRAM
We didn't get into specifics.

DONNA
He doesn't have to sing. He could just talk about debt relief.

RONNA
Oh, my God! Did you talk to him?

BRAM
I talked to a guy named Phil.

JOSH
Okay, invite him to San Diego.

BRAM
Phil?

JOSH
Not Phil.

He and Donna walk away.

DONNA
Press avail on the tarmac in San Diego. You need to be available all day
for phone interviews.

JOSH
Yep.

DONNA
I'm getting a lot of questions on what Santos thinks of Kazakhstan.

JOSH
Tell them Congressman Santos applauds the President's efforts and is glad
the U.S. can share its wisdom with emerging democracies. Then call the White
House and find out what the hell's going on.

DONNA
If Bono comes...?

JOSH
You'll meet him.

She smiles and turns to walk away.

JOSH
Uh, Donna? ...

He seems speechless.

JOSH
I want to, um... I'm sorry. About this morning... it was... inappropriate.

DONNA
Don't worry about it.

JOSH
Totally inappropriate; I feel terrible.

DONNA
Don't.

JOSH
Seriously.

DONNA
Seriously, it's bound to happen sometime. I'm gonna call the White House,
talk about Kazakhstan.

She walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is talking with Debbie.

BARTLET
I want an evacuation report from FEMA before the San Andreo budget call.

He hands her a folder.

BARTLET
Get C.J.'s comments on this and get Hollings at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

DEBBIE
He's coming in this afternoon.

BARTLET
I still want to talk to him now.

DEBBIE
Did you look at the sketches?

BARTLET
I'll get to them.

DEBBIE
How about now?

BARTLET
A nuclear disaster and a war abroad - I thought they could wait.

DEBBIE
They've been sitting there for days. It makes it look like I don't pick up
after you.

They go over to the desk and look at some sketches.

BARTLET
I don't know what to think of these.

DEBBIE
A simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down.

BARTLET
You think they look like me?

DEBBIE
More or less.

BARTLET
Then they'll do. [pause] What does "more or less" mean?

DEBBIE
Decent likeness, commanding, thoughtful; there's no cane, which is a choice.

BARTLET
You think it's a bad choice?

DEBBIE
I don't know, did you make it or did he make it?

BARTLET
He did.

DEBBIE
Then it doesn't matter.

BARTLET
I'm not going to be standing next to the thing with a running commentary. You
think it's a problem?

DEBBIE
Do you?

BARTLET
Often as not, I don't even use it.

DEBBIE
But you exist in the Zeightgeist with a cane.

BARTLET
I have an idea.

DEBBIE
What?

BARTLET
Let's call Hollings at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

DEBBIE
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Margaret calls from her office.

MARGARET [OS]
Josh on two.

C.J. picks up the phone and starts talking to Josh.

C.J.
Hey, sailor.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

Josh is talking to C.J.

JOSH
Am I calling you or are you calling me?

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
I think I'm calling you.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

C.J. [VO]
How's it feel?

JOSH
Oh, this must be what your first smack high feels like.

C.J. [VO]
Here's hoping it's not followed by a huge crash and years of rehabilitation.

JOSH
Nothing could kill my mood right now, but that was a good try.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Thanks.

JOSH [VO]
We need a briefer to give us a more detailed idea about what's up in
Kazakhstan.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Can you send somebody?

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Funny you should mention it - how about the President?

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Below his pay grade, but we'd love to see him.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
He'd like to meet with the Candidates at the White House tonight.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Are you kidding? For the first time in the history of this race we're not
trailing; we're tied. We pull ahead if we play this thing right. Taking the
guy of the campaign trail so he can have some drinks in the Oval Office is...

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
I know and I'm sorry. And if I had a choice...

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
We're about to go to California. We may win Vinick's home state. He is not...

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Would I be asking if it wasn't important?

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
Diplomatic foray into an entrenched conflict; yes, you have my word: should
Santos win he will continue the President's efforts to negotiate a peaceable
solution.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Okay, let's do it this way: Vinick's coming. I'm sure you don't want the
entire White House Press Corps covering Vinick in the Oval with the President
without Santos.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
I like you less and less.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Will's going to coordinate the talking points with your press people, the
President will brief the candidates. See you tonight.

She hangs up.

CUT TO: EXT. CAMPAIGN SITE - CONTINUOUS

Josh hangs up.

CUT TO: INT. - VINICK'S PLANE - DAY

Sheila, Bob, and Bruno are talking.

SHEILA
The President wants to see both candidates at the White House.

BOB
About what?

SHEILA
Security briefing.

BRUNO
San Andreo?

SHEILA
Wouldn't say.

BRUNO
Why not? Buy some time to sort out the schedule.

BOB
Still stuck?

BRUNO
You're asking me to boost his public appearances while limiting press access,
send him groveling for votes to states he's never had to campaign in before
when all he wants to do is go to California. Yeah, I'm still stuck.

SHEILA
We're not going to California.

BRUNO
I keep telling him that.

BOB
What do you think about a media buy?

BRUNO
In California? You know how expensive that is?

BOB
We're hemorrhaging votes there.

BRUNO
I need the bulk of our money for a media blitz on November 5th; you could
blow the entire budget buying ads in California.

SHEILA
Call Stan. See what he thinks it will cost.

Bob walks off.

BRUNO
How much time does he have?

SHEILA
Two or three days... see how it goes.

BRUNO
That's great. A Republican stumping in Georgia - I'm so glad we've got Ray
Sullivan planning the schedule.

SHEILA
It's not his plan; it's mine.

BRUNO
Oh?


SHEILA
Yes.

BRUNO
I am happy to change tact in light of current developments, but I would
be more comfortable if strategy meetings took place with you, me and the
Senator - not you and Ray Sullivan.

SHEILA
Sullivan's just blowing off steam. Nobody blames you for what's happening;
not me, not the Senator.

BRUNO
I don't care if I'm being blamed; I care if I'm being shoved out.

SHEILA
You're not.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Will walks into C.J.'s office. Kate is already there.

WILL
Hi.

C.J.
Hi.

WILL
And you're here.

KATE
Yes.

WILL
Should I come back?

C.J.
No. This was the point. I've asked for guys from both campaigns to come in
so we can get everyone on the same page with Kazakhstan. You two should work
that out?

KATE
I'll put together a backgrounder and he can adapt that into whatever...

WILL
Talking points.

KATE
Yeah.

WILL
Something they can share with the press.

C.J.
Which won't be the whole story, but better than vamping.

WILL
Sure.

KATE
Great.

C.J.
What?

KATE
What?

C.J.
Is something weird happening?

WILL
Nope.

C.J.
I feel like I'm the heroine in the movie who doesn't know there's a guy
behind the refrigerator with an axe.

KATE
Maybe it's the weather. People feel that way when it's... damp.

C.J.
Thank you, both.

They walk out together.

WILL
We're really bad at this.

KATE
Really bad.

CUT TO: EXT. - CAMPAIGN SITE - DAY

Santos is speaking to a crowd.

SANTOS
You know, in a minute, Dave Matthews is going to come up on this stage...

We pan over to where Josh and Ronna are watching the event.

RONNA
Lou's working with Joey Lucas on the whole, "Voice for a New Generation"
thing. She's going to catch up with us in California.

They start walking.

JOSH
She knows we've got to detour to the White House tonight, right?

RONNA
Yeah. Lou told Annabeth to send Leo tonight to pave the way.

JOSH
That's good. See if we can get Helen there too.

Ronna stops and Josh meets Donna and they start walking.

JOSH
Hey, you've got to get on a plane. Liaise with White House Communications
on the...

DONNA
Kazakhstan thing. Lou told me. I'm on my way. I just wanted to tell you a
rumor I heard from a guy at the Sacramento B.

JOSH
You feel bad for the guys at the B, don't you?

DONNA
I don't.

JOSH
It lacks dignity.

DONNA
They're wondering.

JOSH
You heard a rumor?

DONNA
At first I thought it was allergies because apparently Vinick has a mold
sensitivity and the carpet on the plane isn't all that...

JOSH
Now you're wondering.

DONNA
I'm sorry. They think he has a cold.

JOSH
Vinick?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Oh, my Lord! A cold?!

Bram walks up with a piece of paper.

BRAM
A fax from last...

JOSH
He has a cold?!

Josh looks ecstatic. He looks as if he is going to hug Donna, but bear hugs
Bram instead.

JOSH
Yes!

Annabeth walks up. Josh turns loose of Bram and hugs Annabeth.

JOSH
The gods were listening to me, and they love me!

ANNABETH
Why is there hugging?

DONNA
Vinick has a cold.

ANNABETH
Oh, that's precious.

JOSH
I want to send him some Vick's vapo-rub and a German nurse.

Josh sets Annabeth down.

ANNABETH
Look, I have White House schedulers on the phone, and they seem to think
that Leo has to be at the White House tonight, too.

JOSH
No, seriously. Give me that.

He takes her phone and talks to whoever is on the line.

JOSH
Hi, this is Josh Lyman. Who is this? ... Hi, Roberta. Mr. McGarry can't
make it to the White House tonight. He's campaigning for high government
office. ... Nah, I'm sure it was a mistake. ... Thank you.

ANNABETH
Thanks. Sorry.

JOSH
No worries. Bureaucratic snafu.

Annabeth walks away.

JOSH
So, are they writing about this wonderful cold?

DONNA
They will be.

JOSH
Are they writing about the fact that the Senator's health can't stand up to
the rigors of the campaign, never mind the challenges of the Oval Office.

Josh's phone starts ringing.

DONNA
They won't be impressed; he hasn't been in a close race in thirty years.

JOSH
The beginning of the end, right here.

Josh answers his phone.

JOSH
Josh Lyman.

OPERATOR [VO]
Mr. Lyman, please hold for the President.

There is a pause, then we hear Bartlet's voice.

BARTLET [VO]
Hey, kid. How you doing?

JOSH
Fine, sir. How are you?

BARTLET [VO]
Good, good. Do me a favor: bring Leo with you to the White House tonight,
would you?

He turns away from Donna and Bram.

JOSH
Sir...

BARTLET [VO]
You should tag along and say hello. It'd be great to see you. Thanks, Josh.

He seems distressed at the news. He slowly turns back to Donna and Bram.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
We're going to the White House tonight - Leo, the Congressman... everyone.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - VINICK HQ - DAY

Sheila, Bruno, Bob, and some others are walking and talking. Sheila is on
the phone.

SHEILA
We're going to need little packs of Kleenex in all the Senator's pockets.

BRUNO
Cough drops, cough drops.

SHEILA
And cough drops - something industrial strength; none of that herbal business.

She hangs up.

BRUNO
Pray to whoever you pray to that he doesn't lose his voice.

SHEILA
We should try to give him a day.

BOB
A day off?

SHEILA
He's running a 101 fever. He needs to rest.

BRUNO
Not 21 days out, he doesn't.

SHEILA
You want 21 days of the Walking Wound?

BRUNO
He takes a day off and we confirm every concern the voters have: he's
a dinosaur...

BOB
Not up to the job.

BRUNO
Dead on his feet.

SHEILA
Gentlemen!

ANNIE
Is the Senator here?

BOB
He's doing a Q &amp; A outside. He'll be right in.

SHEILA
Tell Jake I want the Senator's wake-up call pushed to 7 am tomorrow, not 6.

ANNIE
Okay. These are for you.

BOB
Which event are we killing so he can sleep in?

SHEILA
It's an hour. We're not talking about it anymore.

Sheila has read one of the messages given to her. She looks displeased.

SHEILA
Hodder from the RNC would like a few minutes with the Senator without staff.

BRUNO
The only time they request meetings without the staff is when the meeting
is about the staff. Should I pack my pencils and coffee mugs now?

SHEILA
Stop it. Annie, call Hodder's office. Tell them 4 o'clock.

ANNIE
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Will is walking. He meets Donna.

DONNA
Hey, Will.

WILL
Hey, look at you: back in the building. Congratulations on your forward surge.

DONNA
Can you believe it? We're all walking ten feet off the ground.

WILL
You gonna go visit your old desk?

DONNA
Oh, not a lot of nostalgia there, really.

WILL
I've got the talking points on the Kazakhstan negotiations, but Vinick's
press guy is running a little late so we should give it a minute.

DONNA
Sure.

WILL
You want a soda?


DONNA
I'm fine.

WILL
I'm going to have a ginger ale.

DONNA
Good. Good.

They walk into Will's office.

DONNA
Can I ask you a question?

WILL
Sure.

DONNA
It's going to sound a little wacky.

WILL
Go for it.

DONNA
If something had happened with us, when we were working, romantically,
would that have been inappropriate?

WILL
Wow, uh... I'm flattered, but...

DONNA
Oh, no, no, no.

WILL
I'm actually seeing someone in a very nonpublic and poorly defined way.

DONNA
No, not you. I was talking about someone like you with your job in relation
to me.

WILL
You're talking about Josh?

DONNA
You're seeing someone?

WILL
You're seeing Josh?

DONNA
No.

WILL
Then who?

DONNA
I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.

WILL
Yours is Josh; you're not cryptic.

DONNA
And yours is...

WILL
Classified.

DONNA
Nothing happened with me and Josh, at all. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
brought this up. We should drop it.

WILL
Good idea. [pause] It's not inappropriate. Seeing someone, that is. It's a
little weird, maybe. But you'll figure it out.

CUT TO: INT. - VINICK HQ - DAY

Sullivan walks into the room where Bruno and Sheila are waiting on Hodder
to show up.

SULLIVAN
Did they start?

SHEILA
Who?

SULLIVAN
Hodder.

SHEILA
They're not here yet but I really don't think you need to be here.

SULLIVAN
The Chairman asked me to sit in. Ah, here he is.

Hodder walks in, accompanied by a woman whom Sheila recognizes.

SHEILA
What's she doing here?

HODDER
Good to see you, Sheila.

SHEILA
Mr. Chairman.

HODDER
You remember Jane Braun.

SHEILA
Sure.

JANE BRAUN
How are you?

SHEILA
Bruno Gianelli, Jane Braun from the RNC, and Chairman Hodder you know.

BRUNO
Mr. Chairman.

HODDER
How you doing? Ray, thanks for joining us.

SHEILA
The Senator's on a call. He'll be here any minute.

HODDER
World upside down, huh?

SHEILA
It'll right itself in a day or two.

JANE
How's he feeling? Rumor has it he has a little bit of a...

SHEILA
He's fine.

JANE
Oh, good.

HODDER
I hear you're going to spend a couple days below the Mason-Dixon Line. That'll
help.

SHEILA
I think it will.

HODDER
Message-wise?

SHEILA
Message-wise, we're holding center.

JANE
Are you sure that's your strongest play?

BRUNO
We need to win back the undecideds, right now. Moderates.

JANE
I can see how you'd come to that conclusion, but I'm not sure it's about
changing minds anymore. It's kind of late for that.

BRUNO
Three weeks is enough time.

JANE
You can't count on it. What you can count on is getting out the vote. And the
foot soldiers of the Republican base will do that for you if the candidate
starts speaking their language.

BRUNO
Here we go.

JANE
It's time to start talking about values, and family.

BRUNO
By which you mean what? Gay marriage?

JANE
I think the list of family values is longer than just "The One" but, since
you mention it...

HODDER
We play the gay marriage card, Santos will have to respond. Conservatives
will flock to Vinick.

SHEILA
The Senator doesn't think that marriage is a federal issue.

JANE
The Senator should rethink it.

SHEILA
Is that what you plan on telling him?

JANE
Guys, you're up against the wall. You had some maverick ideas early on and
they played beautifully. But now it's time to run a safe, sober campaign
that speaks to the concerns of the Republican base.

BRUNO
And what exactly do you think that looks like?

SHEILA
We don't need to get into it.

BRUNO
I'm interested.

JANE
You make it clear to the base that Vinick is their candidate. They can count
on him.

BRUNO
You didn't pull these policies out of a hat. They're Senator Vinick's
positions.

JANE
I wouldn't broadcast that.

BRUNO
Meaning what?

JANE
He's sending the message that he got bad advice early on. He was listening
to strategists who steered him off course...

SHEILA
I think we've got the idea.

HODDER
It's something you should think about.

SHEILA
Sure.

HODDER
Don't be flip about this. There are down-ticket races to consider. We could
lose the House and the Senate. Now Arnie's alienated a lot of our people...

ANNIE
Excuse me. The Senator's ready now.

HODDER
Great.

ANNIE
Right this way.

JANE
Excuse me.

HODDER
Good to see you.

BRUNO
Pleasure.

Hodder and Jane walk off.

BRUNO
You still think they're not trying to replace me?

SHEILA
Oh, they're definitely trying to replace you - with her, apparently.

CUT TO: INT. - LOBBY - WHITE HOUSE - EVENING

Donna is seated in the lobby. C.J. walks in and over to where she's sitting.

C.J.
Hey, stranger.

DONNA
Hi.

C.J.
Did Will get you up to speed?

DONNA
Yes. I'm just hanging here until the Congressman and everyone gets in.

C.J.
It's so good to see you.

DONNA
You too.

C.J.
You must be having a good day.

DONNA
Amazing.

C.J.
How's Josh?

DONNA
What do you mean?

C.J.
Which part tripped you up?

DONNA
Oh, you're... you're just...

C.J.
Asking how he is.

DONNA
Oh, sorry. He's, um... he's fine. Happy we're doing so well.

C.J.
What's going on?

DONNA
Nothing.

C.J.
Is something... is a Josh thing going on?

DONNA
No. No, no, no, no.

C.J.
Something happened.

DONNA
Nothing.

C.J.
Oh, come on. You've got a useless poker face. I spend my whole day talking
about election monitors in Central Asia. Throw me a bone.

Donna sighs.

DONNA
It's nothing. We just... we had an odd moment today. Just another in a
long series of odd moments meant to be ignored. You should focus on your
election monitors.

C.J.
That was a complete and utter failure.

DONNA
That's too bad.

C.J.
It is.

They look up to see Vinick, Sheila, Bruno, and Bob walk in. Debbie meets
them to show them in.

DEBBIE
Would you come with me, please?

Vinick nods toward C.J.

VINICK
Evening.

C.J.
Senator.

They walk out of the lobby toward the Mural Room.

DONNA
Wow. I don't like how that looks.

C.J.
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - EVENING

DEBBIE
Make yourselves comfortable. The President will be right with you.

VINICK
Thank you.

DEBBIE
Not too comfortable.

She moves to shut the door.

VINICK
Excuse me?

DEBBIE
Hmm?

VINICK
Did you...?

DEBBIE
What?

VINICK
Nothing.

DEBBIE
If there's anything I can get you, please let me know.

She shuts the door.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE - EVENING

Carol is showing Santos and his entourage into the Roosevelt Room.

DONNA
Vinick just came through. I think they put him in the Mural Room.

JOSH
A little too close to the Oval for my taste.

CAROL
The President will be with you in just a few minutes.

JOSH
Thanks, Carol.

They come in and set their stuff around the table. Debbie comes in.

DEBBIE
Can I get anybody anything to drink?

SANTOS
Oh, we're fine. Thank you.

DEBBIE
Good. Mr. McGarry, could you come with me, please?

He leaves while everyone else, looking a little uncertain, finds a seat.

JOSH
I have no idea.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - EVENING

Vinick is getting comfortable when they hear a door close in the other
room. They look over to see Debbie lead Leo into the outer office. He stops
while she sees if the President is ready. He looks over to see Vinick and
Co. in the Mural Room. Vinick also looks up, just in time to see Leo being
led into the Oval.

VINICK
Why are we sitting out here while the Democratic VP candidate is being
ushered into the Oval Office?

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

The staffers are talking and having a good time.

BRAM
They wanted to show me. I thought it was my job to keep them away from
the Congressman.

SANTOS
You are a brave soldier, Bram. I'm touched. I really am.

BRAM
Anytime, sir. We're at the Marriot tonight. Take-out phone lists are in the
packet, but the restaurant in the hotel should be open when we get back.

RONNA
I want a room with a view. Last time we were here I was over the dumpster.

BRAM
You're on the second floor.

DONNA
No view, is what he's saying.

BRAM
You know, I was going to go over to the hotel and look out every window,
but somehow I didn't get to it.

ANNABETH
You like "Dawn of a New America"?

JOSH
Not really.

ANNABETH
How about "A New Plan for a New America"?

JOSH
"New America" sounds a little colonial, doesn't it?

ANNABETH
How do you feel about stumping in a pilgrim hat?

SANTOS
I love it.

ANNABETH
"A Brave and Bold Visionary" ought to work.

SANTOS
This is me talking about myself?

JOSH
It's language Joey and Lou have poll-tested. We're trying to work it into
the stump.

SANTOS
Let me see.

ANNABETH
We're just looking to capitalize on our country's new vision of you, sir -
post-nuclear debacle.

SANTOS
"Brave and Bold"?

JOSH
As opposed to Vinick, who's...

RONNA
"Big and Bad."

SANTOS
I don't think we need it.

ANNABETH
It polled well.

SANTOS
You can't poll people three days after a crisis. They're speaking from a place
of anxiety and confusion. They're answers are going to be all over the map.

JOSH
You want to just stay the course?

SANTOS
We have their attention now. They're finally listening. We stick with it,
maybe they'll get the sense that we've been on the right track all along.

ANNABETH
"Santos: Right From the Start."

JOSH
We want that on every bumper sticker, every press release... everything.

RONNA
That was some impressive teamwork there.

ANNABETH
It was, wasn't it? I'm a little teary.

They laugh.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - NIGHT

Vinick, Sheila, and the other staffers are still waiting. Vinick blows
his nose.

SHEILA
I'm going to have a doctor come by in the morning and make sure it's not
strep or something.

VINICK
It's nothing. I'm fine. It's allergies.

BRUNO
Until the "allergies" clear up, I think a cough suppressant might make the
day go a little faster.

SHEILA
You want to talk about what happened in your meeting with Hodder?

VINICK
I don't. You want to talk about why we're admiring the China while McGarry's
in there with the President?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Bartlet is seated at the desk. Leo is sitting across from him.

BARTLET
We're setting up a no-fly zone over Kazakhstan. Step one of a two-month ramp
up with probably a five-year commitment on the ground. NATO's waving us into
the fray with absolutely no intention of following.

LEO
It figures. Did you evacuate the embassy?

BARTLET
Not yet.

LEO
So, it's rapid deployment of what, 10,000?

BARTLET
12. The dream scenario is we put them in the middle of the buffer zone which
scares everyone enough to drive the Russians and the Chinese back on their
own soil. Otherwise, we follow with another 100,000.

LEO
Have you thought about air strikes? Hit a few military targets?


BARTLET
I'm willing to threaten air strikes, but I don't want to tear up the Kazakh
countryside just to make a point.

LEO
So you send in 100,000 men, push the lines back. Then you're security
guard until they get a new government up and running. It's a reasonable
move. You put a massive force on the ground for deterrent purposes, you nip
the conflict in the bud. I'd be surprised if either China or Russia actually
wanted a real battle.

BARTLET
Maybe. That, or we're stuck between two 1,000,000-man armies spoiling for
a fight.

LEO
You don't know until you're in it.

BARTLET
You think I should be sending another negotiating team?

LEO
Armies are already on the ground. Nobody's going to agree to a cease-fire
until they know you're serious about getting involved.

BARTLET
Yeah. This is what they'll remember 50 years from now.

LEO
About your presidency?

BARTLET
Got us into a big mess, then left it to someone else to clean up.

LEO
Oh, come on. They'll remember eight years of strong leadership, growth... a
Commander in Chief they could trust.

BARTLET
You know what'll probably happen? It goes badly, I get the blame. It goes
well, the next guy gets the credit.

LEO
Sounds about right.

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

Carol comes in.

CAROL
The President's ready for you.

Santos stands and leaves the room.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Debbie opens the door to the Mural Room.

DEBBIE
Sorry for the wait.

Vinick stands and follows Debbie. Santos has just come into the office when
Vinick steps out of the Mural Room. They say nothing to each other.

DEBBIE
Gentlemen.

They follow the generals into the Oval.

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT

Leo walks in, hangs his coat on the chair and sits.

JOSH
Everything okay?

LEO
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

The generals, C.J., Bartlet and the candidates are talking about the
Kazakhstan situation.

WENDELL
The initial incursion would be small: 2,000 troops there to defend the embassy.

SANTOS
Does the embassy require that much defense?

HUTCHINSON
Not really.

C.J.
Hopefully, Tarimov takes it as an indication of our commitment and resumes
negotiations.

SANTOS
If he doesn't?

WENDELL
Two rapid deployment divisions are dropped in within 24 hours. The rest of
the ground troops follow over the next eight weeks.

VINICK
Who are we dealing with at the Kremlin?

KATE
Chigorin's been unwilling to engage, as you might expect. The foreign
minister is communicating, but we get the sense he's been pushed out of the
decision-making process.

BARTLET
Thank you all.

The generals get up and leave. The candidates, C.J. and Bartlet stay.

BARTLET
One of you will inherit this pinata. I just thought you should know what's
on the table.

VINICK
I was under the impression that diplomatic options hadn't been exhausted.

BARTLET
That's what we've been saying. I wish it were true.

SANTOS
What about an international force.

BARTLET
We've asked, but NATO's participation would be nominal at best.

VINICK
So we're placing ourselves on an oil field between two nuclear powers, alone.

BARTLET
Yes.

VINICK
I don't see our presence as doing anything more than exacerbating the
conflict. Once we're involved, India will have to diplomatically with the
Russians.

SANTOS
Pakistan will support China. South Korea will feel pressured to engage on
our side.

VINICK
I'm not sure what our side is.

BARTLET
Gentlemen, let's talk about what we're talking about. You're worried that
I'm going to announce I'm deploying 150,000 American soldiers three weeks
before the election and suddenly your race is about my war.

Santos and Vinick glance at each other.

BARTLET
You can speak candidly.

SANTOS
It does change the nature of the election. But more importantly, a new
President would have an easier time brokering a diplomatic solution.

BARTLET
If I thought we could wait until after election, we would wait.

VINICK
What's this going to cost?

BARTLET
It depends on how long we stay.

SANTOS
It doesn't matter. The first 100 days in office are the most productive
of the whole term and there's no way we can extricate ourselves from from
something like this in three months. It's not about the money. You're blowing
any political capital we might have by forcing us to fight a war.

VINICK
Do we have an estimate?

BARTLET
First twelve months: 70 billion.

VINICK
I can say goodbye to my tax cut. Your education plan is certainly off the
table. What's a victory in this?

BARTLET
The retreat of Russian and Chinese military forces across their own borders,
and a stable, neutral, and democratic government in Kazakhstan.

VINICK
Wait, no. That's... here's where you lose me. Everyone back to their corner,
I understand. A stable democratic regime in a former Soviet central Asian
republic, that could take two, three generations. I mean, if that's your
definition of success, I'm not sure I see a clear exit strategy.

BARTLET
It's a realistic concern.

SANTOS
Is there an exit strategy?

BARTLET
General Schultz will tell you there is. He'd tell you we stabilize Astana,
hold new elections in ten months, and pull out in 18. But I'm not sure I'd
buy that anymore than you do.

SANTOS
What's your exit strategy?

BARTLET
I don't have one. I suggest you both start giving it some thought.

They stand.

BARTLET
I appreciate your concerns, but I am not in a position to hold off our
involvement. These armies are marching toward each other and someone must
stand in the middle. Unfortunately, it has to be us.

He shakes their hands.

BARTLET
Thank you for coming in. Good luck to you both.

Bartlet exits through the portico door, leaving Vinick and Santos alone.

CUT TO: INT. - LIMO - NIGHT

Vinick is riding back with Sheila.

SHEILA
What'd the President want?

He says nothing.

SHEILA
Lozenge? [pause] We have to talk about the Chairman.

VINICK
Yeah.

SHEILA
He's a weasel and I don't like that woman, but they're right. A little
campaign shake up might create enough of a diversion to get us past San Andreo.

VINICK
Bruno's worked hard for us. He's not the reason we're in the toilet. I think
firing him will just get us a whole lot of nothing, but if you want to do it,
do it.

SHEILA
I'm not talking about Bruno.

He realizes who she's talking about.

SHEILA
Bruno doesn't have the visibility to be a viable scapegoat. I'm the public
face of your campaign staff. You want this to work, it's got to be me.

VINICK
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. No really, from a smart woman,
that's an incredibly stupid idea.

SHEILA
You need someone to blame for the fact that we didn't campaign to the
base. You need to apologize for that misstep and spend the next three weeks
singing their song.

VINICK
I'm not doing it.

SHEILA
Don't interrupt me. I can still be on the phone with you 24/7. Hire Jane
Braun. And once we get a 51% strategy in place, Bob and Bruno can execute it.

VINICK
We're not losing. We're just in a real horse race now. I'll hop myself up
on Sudafed tomorrow. Santos will be back in the dust by Friday.

SHEILA
Jane is rainmaker at the RNC. She is the darling of the evangelical
right. They will respond to her. She'll whip them up into a door-knocking,
pavement-pounding frenzy.

VINICK
You're really talking about this?

SHEILA
I made a promise to put you in office, and that's what we're going to do.

VINICK
So, that's it? Tomorrow morning I get a letter of resignation?

SHEILA
It's already in your briefcase.

The limo has stopped.

SHEILA
You just have about ten minutes of grip-and-grin here. When you get home,
call Jane.

Vinick gets out. The motorcade drives on. He stands, contemplating for a
time until a staffer speaks to him.

STAFFER
Would you like your overcoat?

VINICK
What?

STAFFER
Would you like your overcoat, sir? It's pretty cold.

VINICK
No.

CUT TO: INT. - HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

Bram, Donna, Ronna, and Edie are talking.

BRAM
We dealt with the relevant information.

RONNA
Oh, my God. You got her phone number, didn't you?

BRAM
I'm not at liberty to share that information.

RONNA
Oh, you're plummeting in my estimation right now.

Josh walks up.

EDIE
How'd it go?

JOSH
Fine.

BRAM
What'd they talk about?

JOSH
You, actually. All three of them, in the Oval.

DONNA
Bram's dating some girl in the Santos' Undies.

BRAM
I'm not dating her.

JOSH
That's impressive, really. It brings honor to the family.

EDIE
If Bono comes, we are locking him in the Secret Service room.

The conversation blurs and Josh and Donna glance at each other. Donna sets
a small envelope with a key in it on the table and slides it toward Josh.

DONNA
Okay. Order me a Perrier. I'm turning in.

Donna walks off. Ronna notices that Donna left her key on the table.

RONNA
Oh, she forgot her key. Donna!

JOSH
I'll take it to her.

EDIE
I've got it. I'm going up anyway.

Ronna hands the key to Edie, who gets up and catches up with Donna to give
it back. Donna looks back at Josh and gives him an, "Oh well," kind of
look. Donna and Edie walk away toward their rooms.

CUT TO: INT. - SIT ROOM - NIGHT

Bartlet is standing at the end of the table, looking at the map. Wendell is
on the phone.

WENDELL
Sir, we have Des Ops, on your order.

Bartlet nods.

WENDELL
Des Ops, we have a go.

We close with a close-up of Bartlet's face.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
