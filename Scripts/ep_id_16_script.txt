2:38 A.M. EST

CUT TO: INT. BARTLET'S LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Leo are inside the limousine. It's headed for the airport.

BARTLET
I don't like putting him in this position.

LEO
I know.

BARTLET
I just don't want you to think that I'm getting any pleasure in putting him
in this
position.

LEO
Well, he knew the vote was going to be tight.

BARTLET
It's ironic.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I mean it's ironic that it all comes down to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
50-50 tie.

LEO
I understand the irony.

BARTLET
Are you being brusque with me?

LEO
It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

BARTLET
I'm just saying you can't blame me. It's what you get from having an even
number
of senators.

LEO
Yeah, you should blame the constitution.

BARTLET
That's what I usually do.

LEO
Yep.

BARTLET
[to Ron in front]
Ron, am I going to meet her on the plane?

RON
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[to Leo]
Zoey got a new agent on her detail.

LEO
I heard.

BARTLET
Have you seen these new agents?

LEO
I've seen them.

BARTLET
They've got the hair, the backpacks, the clothes. Walking around campus
strapped to a
44 magnum.

LEO
They really blend in, huh?

BARTLET
Let me tell you something, when it's your kid, you don't want them blending
in. You
want them wearing a sign that says, "I'm carrying a loaded gun, and the
safety's off."

LEO
[pause] Can I say this one last time?

BARTLET
No.

LEO
If you get tired--

BARTLET
Leo.

LEO
Stay at the hotel for the night.

BARTLET
I won't get tired.

LEO
You're not going to sleep on the plane, you're going to be running around
all day,
and then you've got the fundraiser to do at night.

BARTLET
I want to come home after the fundraiser.

LEO
That's a full day and night. Round trip, D.C. to L.A. in 24 hours. It's
really no
good for you.

BARTLET
It'll be fine.

LEO
[beat] Be that way.

BARTLET
Your impersonation of my mother is getting sharper and sharper, you know that?

LEO
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
The limo pulls up to the Air Force One on the tarmac. Bartlet and Leo step
out.

LEO
Have a good flight, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'll see you tomorrow.

He sees C.J. and Charlie, who are walking up to the limo. They join him in
walking up
the stairs to the plane.

BARTLET
C.J.! Charlie! My flying companions!

C.J.
Good morning, Mr. President.

CHARLIE
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Is everybody on board?

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Press in a good mood?

C.J.
No, Mr. President, I wouldn't say they were.

BARTLET
Why not?

C.J.
Well, they're not wild about taking off at 3 0'clock in the morning, sir.

BARTLET
Oh, it's going to be great. We're going to race the sun to the pacific
horizon!

C.J.
I'll be sure to tell them that, sir. I'm sure it'll pick them right up.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet, followed by C.J. and Charlie, enters Air Force One, walking down
the aisle
as he talks to people.

BARTLET
Morning, Everyone. Sam, it's going to be 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit.

SAM
I can still make a couple of calls.

BARTLET
Make all the calls you want, it's going to be 50-50.

Josh and Toby join Bartlet as he walks down the aisle.

TOBY
Sir, Josh and I would at least like the opportunity to talk about the Al
Kiefer
meeting.

BARTLET
You two are so freaked out about this Al Kiefer meeting.

JOSH
Sir.

Bartlet stops and picks up the intercom phone on the wall of the plane.

BARTLET
We'll listen to him, Josh.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You two want to see the best part about having my job?
[into the Intercom] Colonel, this is the president. I'm ready to go.

The engines fire up as Bartlet hangs up the phone.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
3:45 AM EST
C.J. and Donna chat in their seats, camera slowly pans to see Josh, Toby
and Sam
sitting next and across from them, Josh and Sam hunkered in and eyes shut,
but not
necessarily asleep.

DONNA
It's fantastic. It's Clinique's city block oil for daily face protector.

C.J.
SPF-15?

DONNA
I brought the SPF-15 and the SPF-30.

C.J.
Have you tried the Lancome high-protection sunstick for face and lips?

DONNA
No, did you bring it?

C.J.
Plus the Elizabeth Arden modern skin care daily moisturizer.

TOBY
The two of you understand that we're going to be in California for one day?

C.J.
There's tanning time between 2 and 4.

DONNA
And I have sensitive alabaster skin.

C.J.
Me too.

JOSH
Cameron's going to introduce a bill tomorrow.

SAM
[eyes still shut] Gays in the military?

JOSH
Yup.

C.J.
It's Cameron. Who cares?

JOSH
I have a feeling Ted Marcus might care.

SAM
He's not going to know.

JOSH
He might.

TOBY
You've been in the air all night, you don't know anything, you'll get back
to him.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Plus, it's Cameron. So, who cares?

JOSH
Marcus is going to care.

CHARLIE
[walking up] C.J., you wanted me to let you know when it looked like he was
heading
for the cockpit?

C.J.
Thank you. [getting up] This man has got to be stopped!

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Zoey is reading on a couch. Charlie sits down next to her.

CHARLIE
How you doing?

ZOEY
Hi.

CHARLIE
Listen, uh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to be as attentive on this
trip as
you would like.

ZOEY
That's okay. You're working.

CHARLIE
Well, I've been trying to listen to some of the many lessons you've been
giving me on
how to be a better boyfriend and I know that attentiveness--

ZOEY
No, this is one of the times when it's okay.

CHARLIE
Okay. It's hard to tell the difference between those times and the other
times.

ZOEY
I know. Doesn't that suck for you?

CHARLIE
A little bit, yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Ron Butterfield is escorting a woman to Bartlet's cabin.

RON
Don't be nervous.

WOMAN
Yeah.

Ron knocks on the door.

BARTLET [OS]
Come on in.

Inside THE PRESIDENT'S ROOM, Bartlet is sitting at his desk as Ron and the
woman,
Special Agent GINA TOSCANO, enter.

RON
Mr. President, this is special agent Gina Toscano.

BARTLET
[shaking her hand] How do you do?

GINA TOSCANO
How do you do, Mr. President?

RON
I'll step out, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you, Ron.

Ron exits.

BARTLET
[to Gina] I'm sorry we haven't had a chance to meet before now. You've been
with
Zoey's detail, what?

GINA
Two weeks today, sir.

BARTLET
You were in the army?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How did you get there?

GINA
I was Army ROTC.

BARTLET
Where?

GINA
University of Virginia.

BARTLET
You were a Mountaineer.

GINA
That's West Virginia, Mr. President. I'm a Cavalier.

BARTLET
With a degree in?

GINA
Criminology, sir.

BARTLET
So, you were commissioned a second lieutenant?

GINA
Yes, sir, with military police.

BARTLET
How old are you?

GINA
I'm 27, sir.

BARTLET
How long have you trained for this assignment?

GINA
A year and a half, sir.

BARTLET
What, were you the first one to sign up?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
All right.

Gina sits down.

BARTLET
You know Zoey's dating my body man, Charlie Young, right?

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You know about the letters?

GINA
Of course, sir.

BARTLET
Are they white supremacists?

GINA
I can't tell you for sure, Mr. President. We've been working fairly closely
with the
Southern Poverty Law Center and their database.

BARTLET
You don't have an artist's sketch, or psychological profiles, or anything?

GINA
Not much of either one, Mr. President, but I know what I'm looking for in
a crowd if
that's what you're asking me, sir.

BARTLET
It is.

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience,
and
I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey
to be
comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the
slip. It's
not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to
tell me if
she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's
doing
with her friends. You know what your job is.

GINA
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

GINA
[gets up and shakes his hand] Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Gina?

GINA
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it.

GINA
No deal, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Okay.

Bartlet smiles as Gina exits.

We see a long view of the White House down 17th Street.
WASHINGTON, D.C.
6:30 AM EST

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Larry and Ed are following Leo to his office.

LEO [VO]
We didn't say it enough.

LARRY
We agree.

LEO
Ethanol accounts for 20 percent of Iowa's corn crop.

ED
Which doesn't mean a lot outside of Iowa.

LARRY
But still.

ED
The Ethanol tax credit created...

LARRY
It created 16,000 new jobs.

LEO
That's what we never said enough.

LARRY
We agree. Is it over?

LEO
Sam's been calling senators from the plane for the past hour and a half. The
next time
my phone rings, it's going to be him telling me it's over.

ED
At least we're going to win.

LEO
Yeah.

Margaret enters the LEO'S OFFICE as Larry and Ed exit.

LEO
Good morning.

MARGARET
Good morning, Leo. You need to sign this.

LEO
[signs] Okay.

MARGARET
And this.

LEO
[signs] Okay.

MARGARET
Where it says your name, Leo. You're not the Belgian Foreign Minister.

LEO
Look, I said I was sorry.

MARGARET
I'm not upset.

LEO
I had to stay behind for this.

MARGARET
Of course.

LEO
There will be other trips, Margaret.

MARGARET
I know. [Leo looks at her] There will be other trips.

LEO
Good.

MARGARET
Just not to California.

LEO
Yes, to California.

MARGARET
When?

LEO
They've got 54 electoral votes out there. Something tells me that we're not
going to
be strangers.

The phone rings. Margaret answers.

MARGARET
Leo McGarry's office. [hands the phone to Leo] It's Sam. [heads for the door]

LEO
[to Margaret] Get the Vice President over here. [to Sam] Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE
5:40 AM PST
In the Press section of Air Force One the reporters are sleeping. C.J. walks
up the aisle.

C.J.
You guys? Everyone? Sorry, but we're landing in a few minutes, and I just
wanted to brief
everyone on the President's schedule. The President will be greeted at the
airport by
Congressmen Hark and Jennsen, the Mayor and various City Council Members. It's
photos
only, no formal remarks. We will depart the airport at 6:20 and head for
the hotel, at
which point I predict that we will no longer be on schedule.

CUT TO: EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
The Air Force One is pulling up on the tarmac.

C.J. [VO]
At that time, the President will get his morning security briefing, followed
by 2 hours
of personal staff time.

CUT TO: EXT. LOS ANGELES AREA - DAY
The motorcade is making its way down Sepulveda Boulevard.

C.J. [VO]
At 10 am, we leave for Orange County, where the President has a meeting with
civil leaders
to hear discussion on the current proposal to amend the Constitution to
prohibit burning
the flag. At 3pm, we head out to a church in South Central for a town hall
meeting on
school vouchers.

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE SHERATON HOTEL - DAY
The press vans are pulling up to the Sheraton Universal.

C.J. [VO]
That takes us to tonight and the event you've all been waiting for, the
fundraiser at the
home of Theodore Marcus. The press will wear coats and ties, and you will
stay in the
roped-off area outside, unless you've got $50,000 a couple to take a look
at the good
stuff. Welcome to Los Angeles, where the local time is 5:40 AM, and the
temperature is...
ooh, a balmy 73 degrees.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY
Josh is trying to get his door open at the hotel. Donna walks up as he's
struggling with
his card key.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Need any help with your luggage, there?

JOSH
No, you're fine.

Donna arrives with a few small paper slips, while Josh struggles with the
door handle.

DONNA
There were messages for you at the desk.

JOSH
I've spent half the nights in my life in hotel rooms, and I still cannot...

DONNA
Dave Levy.

JOSH
Later. You sure this isn't for your room?

DONNA
It's for your room. Mandy?

JOSH
Ugh, later. You sure?

DONNA
It's for your room. The deputy whip?

JOSH
Later. You know, there used to be keys...

DONNA
Hold on. [takes the card from him and sticks it in the door.]

JOSH
You stuck it in, you turned it, you...

Donna opens the door easily.

JOSH
I loosened it for you.

Inside the HOTEL ROOM, Josh gets settled in.

DONNA
Ron Dreyfuss from political affairs.

JOSH
Later.

DONNA
Joey Lucas.

JOSH
Really?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
She called?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
She's here.

DONNA
In this hotel.

JOSH
She's here in this hotel.

DONNA
Yes. She's at the fundraiser tonight.

JOSH
Really.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Why did she call?

DONNA
To tell you that she's here in this hotel and she's coming to the fundraiser
tonight.

JOSH
Really.

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Huh.

DONNA
Josh, you've got a crush on Joey Lucas, and I really think you should do
something about
it, because you're starting to bother me.

JOSH
Well, that's something I really care about.

DONNA
Call her right now.

JOSH
I'll see her tonight.

DONNA
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Josh. Do you know what that means? It means
you should
take this time to gather rosebuds, because later on you might not be able to.

JOSH
Interpreting the classics with Poet Laureate Donnatella Moss.

DONNA
I'm just saying, call her and stop bugging me.

JOSH
So, let's call her.

DONNA
Really?

JOSH
Yeah. Let's do it. Call her, and then we'll do everyone else.

DONNA
I have alabaster skin, you know.

JOSH
Dial the phone.

DONNA
I'm just saying. Also, Ted Marcus called.

JOSH
What?

DONNA
Ted Marcus called.

JOSH
Hang on. [beat] I'd better call him first.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. TED MARCUS' MANSION - DAY
8:05 AM, PST
A taxi pulls up to a large mansion in Bel Air. Josh gets out the taxi as
TED MARCUS
walks down the long flight of stairs and exits the house to greet him.

JOSH
Good morning. You beat me to the door.

Josh extends his hand. MARCUS ignores it, and turns to go back into the
house. Josh
follows him, looking around in wonder.

TED MARCUS
Cameron introduced his resolution on the floor this morning.

JOSH
I didn't know that.

MARCUS
House Resolution 973.

JOSH
This is a beautiful house.

MARCUS
Banning gays in the military.

JOSH
I've been on a plane all night.

MARCUS
He introduced it on the floor this morning.

JOSH
Seriously, Studio Chairman -- nice work if you can get it.

MARCUS
Josh, let's not talk about my house.

JOSH
What do you want to talk about?

MARCUS
What do I want to talk about?

JOSH
Ted, I checked into my hotel room 15 minutes ago, what did you haul my ass
out here for?

MARCUS
I think you'd better watch your general tone with me, I'm sending you home
tomorrow with
two and a half million dollars.

They reach the back of the house, where workers are preparing for the evening
fundraiser.

JOSH
Cameron's bill is a joke.

MARCUS
Not to me.

JOSH
It's the House. It's procedure. Do you know how many bills get introduced
every day that
never get a hearing, let alone a vote?

MARCUS
That's it?

JOSH
Yeah.

MARCUS
You came to me with that?

JOSH
I came to you because you told me to, now I've got a cab waiting outside...

MARCUS
Yeah, you're right.

JOSH
Don't worry about it.

MARCUS
I'm being silly.

JOSH
You're worried about nothing. I'll see you later. The President's looking
forward to
the party this evening.

MARCUS
Excellent.

Josh turns to leave.

MARCUS
[to workers] Fellas, you can pack it up, the party's off.

JOSH
Ted. Ted?

MARCUS
Everybody, Carmine, I'm afraid it's not going to happen.

CARMINE
The food, the flowers?

MARCUS
Give 'em out to the guys.

JOSH
You're a rotten bluffer, Ted.

MARCUS
You're right, that's why I never do it.

JOSH
You're not going to cancel the fundraiser.

MARCUS
In fact, I already did.

JOSH
This is the President.

MARCUS
The President is going to be eating room service tonight.

JOSH
Ted.

MARCUS
You've got a cab waiting.

JOSH
That was abrupt. I apologize.

MARCUS
Your apology is accepted.

JOSH
You can't cancel the fundraiser.

MARCUS
Yet, witness the loading of the trucks.

JOSH
This is ridiculous. You're going to be a joke to our people.

MARCUS
Disrespected by the Democratic Party? Whatever will I do?

JOSH
Ted.

MARCUS
Particularly with my 3 billion dollars.

JOSH
Ted, no one is going to pass a bill banning gays in the military. And if
the House ever
passed such a bill, if the Senate every passed such a bill, the President
would never
sign such a bill.

MARCUS
Fantastic.

JOSH
Okay?

MARCUS
Fantabulous.

JOSH
So, you're not going to flake on me.

MARCUS
We're fine.

JOSH
So, the party's still on?

MARCUS
You bet.

JOSH
Good.

MARCUS
As soon as I hear the President say what you just said to me.

JOSH
Look--

MARCUS
Give me a call and let me know what time I should be tuned to my television
to hear
him say what you just said.

JOSH
That's not going to happen, and you know it.

MARCUS
Then we've got a problem. Don't screw around with me, Josh. I've been
President a lot
longer than he has.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is in his office, looking over papers. Margaret enters.

MARGARET
Leo.

LEO
Yeah.

MARGARET
The Vice President.

HOYNES
[enters] Morning, Leo.

LEO
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

HOYNES
Still 50-50, huh?

LEO
That's the way it's going to stay.

HOYNES
Did you talk to Huntington?

LEO
We talked to Huntington. We talked to Gianelli. We talked to Kelly, and
Martinson,
and Rathburn.

HOYNES
Recently?

LEO
This morning. Nobody's moving.

HOYNES
Well, it kind of looked like it was going to turn out that way.

LEO
Not to me. I was surprised.

HOYNES
Well, I was in the Senate with 94 of these guys.

LEO
Anyway.

HOYNES
Yeah.

LEO
The President needs you to go down there and fulfill one of your two
constitutional
responsibilities and vote for the ethanol tax credit. We need you to break
the tie.
He also wanted me to tell you that he regrets putting you in this position.

HOYNES
You got to get me off the hook, Leo. You can't ask me to do this.

LEO
John, I know exactly how you feel.

HOYNES
No, Leo, I don't think you do.

LEO
I know...

HOYNES
I spent 8 years in the Senate voting against this exact tax credit. I was
right, by the
way, and I'm still right, but the point is...

LEO
16,000 new jobs. 4 billion dollars invested in plants and equipment, because
the tax
credit made it economical.

HOYNES
Leo, the ethanol tax credit has accomplished exactly none of its
goals. Production is
close to nothing. It will never be large enough to reduce our dependence on
foreign oil.
And it requires substantial energy to produce, which totally washes out any
overall
conservation effect.

LEO
John?

HOYNES
But that's not the point.

LEO
What's the point?

HOYNES
The Republicans will make me eat it for dinner when my time comes. And you
know that.
So let's get serious.

CUT TO: INT. A HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
In a conference room in Orange County, a gray-haired man speaks from the
head of the
table. They are having the discussion about the flag burning amendment.

MAN 1
Mr. President, I rise today to say that the American flag is probably the
most recognized
symbol in the world. Wherever it stands, it represents freedom. Millions of
American
citizens, who have served our nation in war, have carried that flag into
battle. They
have been killed just for wearing it on their uniforms, because it represents
the most
feared deterrent to tyranny. And that is liberty.

Bartlet and others clap.

MAN 2
[stands] Mr. President, This is not a perfect nation, but to the world outside,
it
represents what is right. And to Americans, it represents what Chief Justice
Charles
Evans Hughes... [Josh, Toby and Sam walk out the door to a
courtyard.] ...referred to
as our national unity, our national endeavor.

CUT TO: EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Josh, Toby and Sam stand by the fence.

JOSH
I just came from Ted Marcus's.

TOBY
What did he want?

JOSH
He's threatening to cancel tonight unless the President comes out publicly
against 973.

SAM
This is one of Cameron's...

TOBY
It's not going anywhere.

JOSH
I explained that.

SAM
And what did he say?

JOSH
He takes it seriously for obvious reasons, and he is distressed by the
President's silence
on the subject, and he feels that it's a betrayal of the gay community for
him to be so
publicly supportive of the President.

TOBY
All right. It is not in the interest of his cause for the President to make
a public
statement today. It'll give credibility and attention...

JOSH
Right.

SAM
And use all those words when you talk to him. Tell him that surely a man of
his media
savvy will understand that the President can't be quite so publicly
blackmailed!

TOBY
And, should the President choose to stay in his hotel room tonight and not
kowtow to the
Hollywood blah, blah, blah, it will only serve to solidify his public
reputation with the
electorate as a man of character.

SAM
Frankly, that buys us more than 2 and a half million dollars worth of support,
anyway.

TOBY
Use those words, and tell him if he goes ahead with the party, he gets 10
minutes alone
in a room with the President.

JOSH
All right, I can sell that.

SAM
Let's go back.

JOSH
How's he doing in there?

SAM
Oh, he's got that look on his face like he's thinking about ways to kill
himself.

CUT TO: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet has that exact look on his face as a woman speaks.

WOMAN
It is disgraceful that some individuals would desecrate the flag that our
nation's
veterans fought so valiantly to protect. [More applause as she sits.]

MAN 3
Mr. President, it is imperative that we enact legal protections... [Charlie
walks over
to Bartlet and whispers in his ear] ...for our flag, and I rise in strong
support for
the flag desecration constitutional amendment.

BARTLET
I'm sorry. I've actually been told that I have to go now. This is a debate
that is
obviously going to continue in town halls, city halls, state legislatures,
and the U.S.
House of Representatives. There is a population in this country that seems
to focus so
much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to
ask this
question -- is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I'm not aware
of?

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Secret Service Agents open the doors as Bartlet and his staff walk outside
to the limos.

BARTLET
I mean it, man, is there an emergency-level outbreak of flag desecration no
one's kept
me posted on?

TOBY
There is not, so let's blow off the Kiefer meeting.

BARTLET
Toby, there is no reason for you to feel threatened by Al Kiefer.

TOBY
I don't.

BARTLET
Excellent. Because we're doing it over lunch.

JOSH
I have to eat with Al Kiefer?

BARTLET
Back at the Hotel.

JOSH
Sir.

BARTLET
Better, yet, Charlie, where is Zoey having lunch?

CHARLIE
A place in Santa Monica called the Playa Cantina?

BARTLET
Why?

CHARLIE
She wanted an L.A. experience, Mr. President.

BARTLET
That supposed to be a good place, Sam?

SAM
Uh, they make guacamole right in front of you.

BARTLET
Is that an L.A. experience?

CHARLIE
I think she meant the people.

BARTLET
Well, there aren't going to be any people today.

CHARLIE
Will you be joining her, sir?

BARTLET
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

CHARLIE
Sir, wouldn't it be easier back at the hotel?

BARTLET
Yeah, but the hotel wouldn't make the guacamole right in front of me.

CHARLIE
How much do you want to bet they would?

JOSH
Sir, I need a minute to talk about Ted Marcus.

BARTLET
We can do it in the car. Who's talking to Leo?

SAM
He's with the Vice President now, sir.

BARTLET
You come in the car, too.

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
BARTLET, his staff and his agents come out of the building. Outside are a
few screaming,
cheering people holding signs.

TOBY
Sir, this lunch with Al Kiefer?

BARTLET
[looks at a group across the street] Those people over there don't like me
too much.

JOSH
Well, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you like we have, sir.

BARTLET
You would honestly think there was an epidemic of flag burning going on,
endangering
countless lives in this country.

TOBY
Don't put too much stock in what he has to say.

BARTLET
I'm having lunch with my daughter, Toby. You guys are going to sit with
Kiefer, and
let me know what's worth listening to.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[to Toby] We'll see you there.

TOBY
What, I'm not coming in the car?

BARTLET
No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole.

TOBY
I didn't!

BARTLET
I could tell you were thinking it.

TOBY
Fair enough.

BARTLET
Good.

Toby walks away as Bartlet and the others get into the limousine.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. THE PLAYA CANTINA - DAY
1:20 PM, PST
The restaurant is empty except for the staff and Secret Service Agents. Sam,
Toby, Josh
and C.J. sit at one table with AL KIEFER. Bartlet and Zoey sit alone at a
table nearby.

ZOEY
Dad, I can't believe you did this.

BARTLET
Surprised you for lunch, I know, I'm the best.

ZOEY
Dad, I wanted to have lunch in Los Angeles--

BARTLET
You are.

ZOEY
With people, with L.A. people. I wanted the atmosphere. And they've cleared
out the place.

BARTLET
Yeah, but on the other hand, the guy made guacamole right in front of us.

ZOEY
Dad!

BARTLET
This is father/daughter fun time.

ZOEY
I was having fun. And then you come within 100 meters of me, and my protection,
like,
quadruples.

BARTLET
Oh, you know, I hadn't thought about that. [looks around] Now that you
mention it, yeah,
I think you're right.

ZOEY
What, is someone after me in California?

BARTLET
All kinds of things in California, Zoey. You've got your smog, your freeway
shootings,
brush fires, mudslides. Plus, apparently, there's a mad rash of flag burning
going on,
and you don't want a piece of that.

ZOEY
See, you think you're funny.

BARTLET
Right there, right in front of me, they made the guacamole. Now, how about
that?

A MOVING SHOT to the table next to them. Al Kiefer speaks.

AL KIEFER
On the flag burning, the bottom line couldn't be clearer. If he says nothing,
he takes
a hit, but not a fatal one. If he stands in opposition to the amendment,
you can all
start updating your resumes.

SAM
I don't buy that.

TOBY
Me, neither.

C.J.
People respect a President who stands by the courage of his convictions.

JOSH
Al.

AL
You are looking at this exactly the wrong way. You don't have to play
defense. You
could lead the charge.

TOBY
You just said that we couldn't.

AL
No, I didn't.

SAM
You just said that if we were vocal in our opposition to flag burning,
then we'd take
a fatal hit.

AL
That's right. And I'm saying don't stay quiet, and don't oppose it. Lead
the charge
the other way.

C.J.
[laughing] What?

BARTLET
C.J., has Al said something that I should listen to, yet?

C.J.
We'll let you know, sir.

AL
Mr. President, do you want to sew up reelection right now? Do you want a
lock on your
second term right here, right now in this room?

BARTLET
What do you got?

JOSH
Why do you encourage him?

BARTLET
What do you got, Al?

AL
A truckload of voters, Mr. President, about 47%. Overwhelmingly white men,
pool and
patio types. Who voted against you by 20 plus points? [suddenly moves over
to Bartlet's
table.] They share an affinity towards authority, a President. And they see
you as
smart and having vision, so why didn't they vote for you? Because they also
see you
as a wimp. Two-thirds of them on a thermometer place you as some degree of
weak.

JOSH
We've heard these numbers before.

BARTLET
Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front
of my
daughter.

AL
Look, I get that this is not the most popular idea in the room. But I got
numbers,
and I know numbers, and I trust numbers. And the reason you're all looking
a little
pale right now is so do you. This is not theoretical. The flag burning
amendment
made it through the House with 20 votes over the required two-thirds. It
hasn't made
it through the Senate yet, but that day will come, that day will come,
that day will
come soon. Laws against flag burning are favored overwhelmingly in the polls,
and a
constitutional amendment won't be subject to a Presidential veto, or
overturning by
the Supreme Court.

TOBY
Look...

AL
This all adds up to one thing, Mr. President. It's over! The game's been
played and
won. But because of guys like me, you get the results before anyone else does,
so you
get to pick which side you're on. And not only do we get to be on the winning
team,
we get to lead the winning team.

Josh's phone rings. He walks away from the table.

JOSH
Excuse me.

AL
Toby, you're smiling.

TOBY
I just figured out who you were.

AL
He's going to say Satan.

TOBY
No. You're the guy that runs into 7-Eleven to get Satan a pack of cigarettes.

CHARLIE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yeah, Charlie. [to the others] We'll talk about this later. [tightens his
tie and
gets up]

TOBY
We will?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE PLAYA CANTINA - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and his staff are leaving the restaurant, via more screaming,
cheering crowds.

JOSH
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Men with pools and patios think I'm weak.

JOSH
I don't want to mention the 49 times we asked you not to take this meeting.

BARTLET
Was that Marcus on the phone?

JOSH
Speaking of natives, we sold him on 10 minutes in a room alone with you,
tonight.

BARTLET
No way I can get out of it?

JOSH
Ten minutes.

BARTLET
I used to like parties, you know that?

As Bartlet gets in his car, Gina and Zoey are just leaving the restaurant.

ZOEY
I just wanted a regular lunch, you know? In a restaurant, with people? My
father sees
danger behind the curtains.

Gina spots two skinhead boys watching them.

GINA
Hey, Zoey, do me a favor and walk on the other side of me, would you?

ZOEY
Gina...

GINA
Let's get in the car, okay?

Gina, one hand on her gun, escorts Zoey into the car, and then knocks on
the roof
once she's in.

CUT TO: EXT. TED MARCUS'S MANSION - NIGHT
The fundraiser has started. Secret Service agents with dogs comb the lower
lawn,
while people party between light strings and flowers.

CUT TO: INT. INSIDE THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS
Violinists play at the top of the stairwell. C.J. and Toby are at the bottom.

C.J.
Look at this house!

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
I mean, look at this house!

TOBY
It's a nice house.

C.J.
You know, you haven't said anything about my dress.

TOBY
You look very nice.

C.J.
You're not even looking.

TOBY
I'm looking at the house.

A Hollywood-type man, MARK MILLER, walks up to them.

MARK MILLER
Excuse me, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Mark Miller. I'm head of new
development
at Paragon.

C.J.
C.J. Cregg.

TOBY
Toby Ziegler.

MARK
Oh, it's good to meet you both. C.J., I was wondering if my money buys me
a few words
alone with you.

TOBY
Throw in a box of chocolates and a pair of nylons, get you a lot more than
that.

C.J.
Sure.

C.J. and Mark start to walk off.

TOBY
I'll be over at the bar, drinking a lot, if anyone wants me.

C.J.
Nobody will.

Toby holds up his glass as Mark and C.J. walk through the house.

MARK
I'll come right out and say it, C.J. I'm a big fan.

C.J.
Thank you.

MARK
Yeah. And I think that there's a place for you in our company.

C.J.
Doing what?

MARK
Development.

C.J.
Of what?

MARK
Development of projects.

C.J.
What's that mean?

MARK
You'd be developing feature projects.

C.J.
Movies.

MARK
Yeah.

C.J.
You know what? You want Toby or Sam. I'm not a writer.

MARK
Oh, no, we have writers.

C.J.
Well, I certainly can't direct or act.

MARK
No, you'd just be in development.

C.J.
And what's that?

MARK
Shepherding projects - developing them.

C.J.
I thought a guy writes a movie, and a guy directs a movie.

MARK
Sure.

C.J.
And in between there are designers and technicians and actors.

MARK
Yes.

C.J.
So, tell me what I do again?

MARK
Development.

C.J.
Okay. Well, at the moment I have a pretty good job and I understand what it
is, so,
uh, I sure appreciate... [spots Sam walking past] Sam! [to Mark] I appreciate
it, Mark,
I'm sorry, I've got to talk to Sam about a thing the President wants me
to... [She
walks away with Sam.] Pretend you're talking to me.

SAM
I am talking to you.

C.J.
Walk me outside.

SAM
Did he offer you a development...?

C.J.
Yes!

SAM
Me, too. Do you know what it is?

C.J.
No.

SAM
Me, neither.

Sam and C.J. move out of camera range as they walk past DAVID HASSELHOFF,
talking to
Donna and Josh near the pool.

DAVID HASSELHOFF
"I think there's a basic bedrock principle behind the first amendment. That
the
government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea just because it's
disagreeable."
Justice William Brennan, writing for the majority.

DONNA
I'm a real big fan, David, not just a Johnny-come-lately. It's not just
Baywatch and
Knight Rider with me.

DAVID
Well, thank you very much. My point is...

DONNA
I mean, Nick Fury, Panic at Malibu Pier, the Cartier Affair. Pleasure Cove,
for crying
out loud.

JOSH
[dragging Donna away] Excuse us.

DONNA
[to Josh, about David] He's so into me.

JOSH
You're frightening the guests.

DONNA
David Hasselhoff, I'm just saying.

JOSH
He's married.

DONNA
This is California, Josh. A girl can dream.

JOSH
[taking her glass] Stop drinking now.

DONNA
Matt Perry, right there, goodbye. [wanders off.]

CUT TO: INT. TED MARCUS'S MANSION - NIGHT
Josh is waking along the pool, amidst the people, as a man calls him from
behind.

MAN
Josh!

JOSH
I know that voice.

Josh turns around to see Joey and her interpreter, Kenny.

JOEY [KENNY]
How long was it going to take for you to say hello to me?

JOSH
I got your phone message this morning, but I've been kind of running around. I
didn't
see you until now.

JOEY [KENNY]
I saw you.

JOSH
Well, then you should have said hello to me.

JOEY [KENNY]
You looked like you were absorbed in high-level conversations.

JOSH
I can assure you, I was not.

JOEY [KENNY]
Well, then.

JOSH
Well then, what?

JOEY
Hello?

JOSH
Hello! [chuckles] Look, uh, we're just here for the day...

TOBY
[walking past] Josh!

JOSH
Uh, yeah. [to Joey] Can you not, uh, not, uh, just don't leave the party,
okay?

JOEY [KENNY]
Okay.

Josh gives her a thumbs up, and follows Toby.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT
Leo escorts Hoynes to his car out front of a building.

LEO
John, I know we've had our ups and downs, but let me be your guy here for
a second.
You can't be thinking about being the first vice president in history to
break a tie
going the other way.

HOYNES
I'm not looking to make history.

LEO
Then what are you looking for, John? You're going to get ink either way.

HOYNES
Leo.

LEO
I know that it eats at you that there is friction between you and my staff. You
think
they don't respect you. And they do. They just don't trust you. And frankly,
neither
does the President.

HOYNES
Well...

LEO
I mean I know that's tough. But God, John, I'm the one that convinced him
to put you
on the ticket. And I'm going to be the one standing here when you make history,
whether
you're going to or not.

HOYNES
Leo, one of these days you're going to have to allow for the possibility
that my motives
might not always be sinister. You are your staff are remarkably smug, and
frankly so is
the President. And the fact that you think I give a damn that there is some
friction
between me and your staff is certainly proof enough of that.

LEO
John, you will not be able to set foot in the West Wing. You will not be on
the ticket
in three years.

HOYNES
Leo, I think you guys set me up.

LEO
You think the President of the United States can arrange for a 50-50 tie in
the Senate?

HOYNES
I think the President of the United States can do pretty much whatever he
wants.

LEO
You're wrong.

HOYNES
Well. Where's the President right now?

LEO
At Ted Marcus's fundraiser.

HOYNES
I think it's time for you to call him. [gets inside his limousine]

FADE OUT
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. PRIVATE AREA IN THE MANSION - NIGHT
11:05PM EST
Leo and Bartlet are talking on the phone. Leo is alone in his office in the
White
House, while Bartlet is in a private room at the party with Josh, Toby and
Sam, who
is holding the receiver so he can talk to Leo.

BARTLET
We're running out of reasons not to fire him, Leo.

LEO
Well, when you run out of reasons, the last reason is that you can't fire
the Vice
President.

BARTLET
I can ask for his resignation, and don't be a smart ass.

LEO
Mr. President, I got to tell you something and you won't like the sound of
it.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
He's right, and we're wrong.

BARTLET
About what?

LEO
About the ethanol tax credit.

SAM
Mr. President, Leo's right.

BARTLET
Sam's weighing in.

SAM
Sir, I put Cambridge, Aiello and Dane in a headlock to vote our way, let's
send them
back. We'll lose 53-47 and we can take the Vice President off the hook.

BARTLET
All right, let's do what Sam said.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I'm not done with Hoynes, but dump it.

LEO
Sir, the thing about the Vice President in this situation...

BARTLET
I'll call him from the plane. [hangs up] Christ, will this damn day never
end?

CUT TO: INT. A PATIO IN THE MANSION - NIGHT
VERONICA WEBB and JAY LENO are talking on the patio.

VERONICA
Jay, you can't drive all those cars you have!

JAY
Well, no, not all at once.

VERONICA
I know not all at once, baby, but you have -

C.J. walks up to them.

JAY
Claudia Jean, this is Veronica Webb.

C.J.
C.J. Cregg.

VERONICA
Well, hi. Nice to meet you.

C.J.
Nice to meet you, too. Jay, can I talk to you for a second?

JAY
Uh, sure.

VERONICA
Sure.

C.J. and Jay walk and talk.

C.J.
Uh, Jay, the President appreciates your laying off Leo McGarry the past few
months.
It hasn't gone unnoticed.

JAY
Hey, you guys give me monologue material every night, you know.

C.J.
Well, if there's anything I can do for you...

JAY
You know what would be great? If you could get the President to drive his
bike into
a tree again. See, that's my bread and butter. That's what I live on.

C.J.
[laughing] You're a very funny boy, Jay. [looks over at another woman]
How does she
look like that?

JAY
Uh, clean living. Prayer.

WOMAN'S VOICE [OS]
C.J.? C.J.!

C.J.
[to Jay] I got to go.

A woman walks up to C.J. Sam is right in front of her.

C.J.
[to the woman] Sorry, there's thing I've got to talk to Sam about... [takes
Sam's
arm and leads him away] Just pretend that you're talking to me again.

SAM
Okay. This time, let's use code names.

C.J.
Where's Josh?

SAM
He's over there talking to that woman.

C.J.
Interesting.

SAM
Of course, it's just possible that they could just be pretending to be
talking.

C.J.
Indeed.

Josh is sitting with Joey and Kenny at a table on the other side of the pool.

JOSH
So, you want to know what we did for lunch today?

JOEY [KENNY]
What?

JOSH
We had a meeting with a democratic pollster who told us that we could sew up
reelection if the President led the charge in favor a flag burning amendment.

JOEY [KENNY]
I heard.

JOSH
How'd you hear?

JOEY [KENNY]
I hear everything. [on Josh's quizzical look] It was a stupid joke. But I
don't
even get a sympathy laugh?

JOSH
[chuckling] Seriously... this guy had some pretty scary numbers.

Sam, Toby and C.J. stop at their table.

C.J.
Josh, I think I just made a three-picture deal.

JOSH
Three-picture deal doing what?

C.J.
It doesn't seem to matter.

JOSH
This is Joey Lucas. This is her assistant Kenny.

SAM
You're running O'Dwyer's campaign in the 46th.

JOEY
Yes.

SAM
Sam Seaborn.

JOEY
Hi.

TOBY
Toby Ziegler.

JOEY
Hello.

C.J.
C.J. Cregg.

JOEY
Hi. I know who you all are.

JOSH
I was just telling her about Kiefer's numbers.

JOEY [KENNY]
I've seen those numbers. We shared the California polling data.

TOBY
And?

JOEY [KENNY]
Kiefer asked the wrong questions. His polls said that 80% of the people,
when asked
if they'd support an amendment prohibiting flag burning said yes, which is
roughly
the same amount of people that say they support sending litterbugs to
prison. He never
asked them how much they care.

TOBY
Please, please say that you did.

JOEY [KENNY]
How good am I looking to you right now?

TOBY
That depends on the California numbers.

JOEY [KENNY]
37%, or less than half of those who said they'd favor the amendment, rated
the issue
fairly or very important. 12%, or less than a third of that group, said that
the issue
would swing their vote. The only place that this war is being fought is in
Washington.

TOBY
You're looking very good to me right now.

JOEY [KENNY]
I thought so.

TOBY
Good to meet you. [gets up, and is followed by C.J. and Sam.]

C.J.
Nice meeting you.

JOSH
[to Joey] Do you have any idea how big you scored with Toby and Sam right
now?

JOEY [KENNY]
Yes. Still. I think if you're going to have the President stand up and say
something
about flag burning, I think he should say that people shouldn't do it. I
think he
should say that it's a form of protest that a lot of people find terribly
troubling.

JOSH
Your polls say that?

JOEY [KENNY]
I said that. So do a lot of people. "Vox populi, Vox dei."

JOSH
"The voice of the people is the voice of a dog"?

JOEY
The voice of God, Joshua!

JOSH
God! Yes.

JOEY [KENNY]
[beat] I came here with someone.

JOSH
I'm... I'm sorry?

JOEY [KENNY]
I came here with someone.

JOSH
Okay, um. I should go. I have to go.

JOEY [KENNY]
Wait, will you call me some time, next time you come out here?

JOSH
Absolutely. I will call in advance of my coming.

JOEY
It was really good to see you.

JOSH
You, too.

CUT TO: INT. A DARK STUDY ROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet and Ted Marcus are talking in a study room in the mansion.

MARCUS
Mr. President, I don't need to tell you that I've got a large microphone at
my disposal,
and I'm going to demand that you publicly announce that you're going to veto
Cameron's
bill if it passes.

BARTLET
It's not going to pass, Ted. It's not going to get voted on.

MARCUS
No, I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol.

BARTLET
And I'm saying as a gesture, as a symbol, you make that public demand, Ted,
and you're
going to be Cameron's best friend.

MARCUS
The people in my house want this. And they're complaining to me that you
take their
money and run, without listening.

BARTLET
Oh, God, Ted! Give me the name of one person who's complaining to you,
and I'll call
them personally and tell them I will never sign a law like that.

MARCUS
Well, then why won't you...

BARTLET
Ted.

MARCUS
Why won't you say that publicly?

BARTLET
[yells] Because I know what I'm doing, Ted! Because I live in the world of
professional
politics, and you live in the world of adolescent tantrum! [beat] Don't you
ever slap
Josh Lyman around again. That guy is the White House Deputy Chief of
Staff. He's not
one of your associate producers.

MARCUS
You're right.

BARTLET
Don't screw around with me now, Ted. I'm really not in the mood.

MARCUS
I mean it. You're right.

BARTLET
Right now, right this second, the worst thing that could possibly happen to
gay rights
in this country is for me to put that thing on the debating table, which is
happens
the minute I open my mouth. Do you get that? I'm a human starting gun,
Ted. You got
to trust me! I know what I'm doing.

MARCUS
I trust you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Do you?

MARCUS
Yes, I do. And I like you, too.

BARTLET
Thank you.

MARCUS
Have you enjoyed yourself tonight?

BARTLET
No.

MARCUS
Me, neither. If you don't mind my saying so, Mr. President, you look more
tired than
you did when I saw you a couple of months ago.

BARTLET
Imagine how tired I'm going to look when you see me a couple of months from
now.
[beat] I haven't slept well, lately. Kept everyone up on the plane as we
flew out.
You know, we left at 3 in the morning? I really want to try to sleep on the
way back.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The fundraiser is over. Josh is packing, while Donna is lying on the bed.

DONNA
That was it?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Just because she said she was with somebody?

JOSH
She said she was with somebody.

DONNA
Oh, Josh!

JOSH
Donna, she's with somebody!

DONNA
She could have just been saying that.

JOSH
Why would she just be saying that?

DONNA
For the allure.

JOSH
Oh.

DONNA
Go see her before we leave.

JOSH
It's one in the morning.

DONNA
Go knock on her door.

JOSH
I'm not going to knock on her door at one in the morning.

DONNA
Yes! Because you're whisking away to Washington, and you had to see her one
more time
before you left, because God knows what fate awaits you when once you get
there.

JOSH
Are you okay?

DONNA
Gather ye rosebuds, Josh.

JOSH
Donna, I am not going to knock on her door

Donna starts clucking like a chicken.

JOSH
Were you just clucking like a chicken, is that what that was?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
I couldn't knock on her door if I wanted to, I don't have her room number.

DONNA
[picks up phone message] Yes, you do.

She waves the message, and in a sing-song voice--

DONNA
Phone Message! Phone message!

JOSH
Okay, first of all, don't do that thing anymore with the phone message! Phone
message!

DONNA
And?

JOSH
Tell them I'll be down in one minute. Wait, how's she going to know I'm
knocking on
the door?

DONNA
There's a button outside, a light flashes.

JOSH
[opening door] Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - OUTSIDE JOEY'S DOOR - NIGHT
Josh arrives at the door and pushes the button repeatedly. The door is
finally opened
by... Al Kiefer, dressed in a white robe.

AL
Josh.

JOSH
Al!

AL
What can I do for you?

JOSH
You know I got the wrong room.

AL
I don't think so. You're looking for Joey?

JOSH
Yeah.

AL
She's right here.

JOSH
No! I'm not. I-I-I was just stopping to say a quick goodbye, don't bother.

JOEY [OS]
Who's out there?

She comes out of the bathroom, also dressed in a white robe. She is clearly
shocked
to see Josh at the door.

JOSH
I wanted to say a quick goodbye. We're taking off. And, uh, thank you for
talking to
us tonight. That was helpful.

Joey signs something at him.

AL
She said goodbye.

JOSH
I know.

Joeey gives him a really sweet smile.

JOSH
Goodbye.

Josh walks away as Al closes the door.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Everyone in the plane is asleep, except Bartlet. He's inside his office,
talking on the phone to Vice President Hoynes.

BARTLET
[into phone] Anyway, Mr. Vice President, it's taken care of, we can put it
to rest.

HOYNES [VO]
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
You're welcome. Bye.

HOYNES [VO]
Good night.

BARTLET
Wait. John?

HOYNES [VO]
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I want to tell you, a couple of years ago in Iowa, I really admired the way
you hung
in there on the ethanol tax credit. You went out to Iowa and said the same
things
you'd been saying in the Senate for eight years, event though you knew it
wasn't going
to play. My confession is, you and I agree on ethanol, but you were the only
one to
say it. You stood in there even though you knew you were going to lose Iowa
and who
knows what after that. Anyway, I just wanted to say you had a good day today,
John.

HOYNES [VO]
Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'm going to try to go to sleep now.

HOYNES [VO]
Good night, Mr. President. See you in the morning.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Bartlet slowly hangs up phone and closes his eyes. As the camera closes in,
his eyes
slowly, and sadly, open again.
