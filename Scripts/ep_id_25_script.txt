JOSH [VO]
(on speaker phone) It's called the Theory of Everything.

FADE IN: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is in her office picking up and putting down various pieces of paper
and files, while
speaking on the phone with Josh.

C.J.
The Theory of Everything?

JOSH (VO)
Yes.

C.J.
Is it comprehensive?

JOSH (VO)
C.J....

C.J. sits down at her desk rummaging through her files.

C.J.
That was a joke there, pal-o-mine.

JOSH (VO)
I want you to lead with this.

C.J.
Carol, I'm missing the OMB stats.

Carol is popping in and out of C.J.'s office handing her different files.

CAROL
They're coming.

JOSH (VO)
C.J. I want you to lead with this.

C.J.
I'm not gonna lead with it.

CUT TO INT. JOSH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Josh is lying in a bed.

JOSH
Yes, you are.

C.J. (VO)
Okay.

JOSH
So, you got it?

C.J.
Sure.

JOSH
I mean, you got what you're suppose to say.

C.J. (VO)
Carol, also the EPA?

CAROL
Committee won't be out 'til 3:00.

JOSH (VO)
C.J. say it for me.

C.J.
He's making me crazy.

JOSH (VO)
You know I heard that.

C.J. (VO)
Yeah, I understand how a speakerphone works.

JOSH
Say it for me.

C.J.
Joshua, I really have to get to the briefing room.

She starts to put on her jacket.

JOSH
Say it please.

C.J.
Psychics at Cal Tech and the FERMI National Accelerator Lab are close to
announcing what...

JOSH
Physicists! Theoretical physicists at Cal Tech...

C.J.
Not psychics?

JOSH (VO)
No.

C.J.
I should jot that down.

JOSH
Please.

C.J.
I tell you if it was psychics I'd lead with it.

C.J. gets up to leave.

JOSH (VO)
C.J...

C.J.
Talk to you later mi amor.

She heads out the door.

JOSH (VO)
I don't think you understand how important this is...

He continues to ramble but there's no one in C.J.'s office.

CAROL
The OMB Stats.

She hands C.J. some papers.

C.J.
Thank you. You can set 'em down and let JOSH rant a little before you hang
up the phone.

CAROL
Sure.

C.J. walks through JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA and runs into Toby and they start
pedeconferencing
down the hall.

TOBY
C.J.

C.J.
Yes, ma'am.

TOBY
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is going to report that the CPI jump 0.7%...

C.J.
Okay...

TOBY
...is the biggest one month increase since the Bureau began tracking prices in
'52.

C.J.
All right, let me say this, the market basket used to calculate the CPI is
antiquated.

TOBY
Say outdated.

C.J.
And doesn't include some regular house hold items...

TOBY
Yes.

C.J.
...like computers...

TOBY
The prices are always dropping...

C.J.
Yes.

TOBY
...and doesn't reflect significant technical improvements like airbags in
automobiles, which
increase the price of the car very slightly, but provide a much greater
value to the consumer.
You got all that?

C.J.
Let's find out.

Toby walks off in another direction and Leo meets up with C.J.

LEO
C.J.

C.J.
Leopold.

LEO
Mention the HUD secretary is announcing changes in the underwriting criteria
for the Federal
Housing Administration.

C.J.
Well, the network's gonna want to break in with special coverage for that.

Leo isn't amused.

LEO
The adjustments are in FHA related lending.

C.J.
Seriously, they're going to need time to put together a logo and theme music.

LEO
You know the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported...

C.J.
Reported the CPI jumped by 0.7%.

LEO
Thank you.

They both enter THE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE and Leo leaves, only to be replaced
by Sam.
Sam catches up as they head for the Press Room.

SAM
C.J.

C.J.
Oh, Holy Interruptus, Batman!

SAM
Grant Samuels died.

C.J.
Really?

SAM
Yes.

C.J.
He's really dead this time?

SAM
Yeah.

C.J.
Cause last time you told me he was dead and he wasn't.

SAM
He's dead this time.

C.J.
Somebody poked him a little to see...

SAM
He died, C.J.!

C.J.
Well, okay, then I shouldn't have made a joke.

SAM
I'm almost certain he's dead.

C.J.
Sam!

SAM
I was making a joke, too! What, you work alone?

C.J.
Give me some...

SAM
He's survived by his wife, Eileen, his son, Robert, his two daughters,
Priscilla and Patty,
and eight grandchildren.

C.J.
I'm not going to learn their names.

SAM
Uh...that's fine.

C.J.
Eileen, Robert, Priscilla, Patty, and eight grandchildren. And I'm assuming
it was
complications due to...

She gives Sam a knowing look.

SAM
Uh... yeah.

C.J.
You know anything about Theoretical Physics?

SAM
Ah... The Grand Unified Theory.

C.J.
You know anything about it?

SAM
No.

C.J.
Okay.

Sam takes off. C.J. continues toward THE PRESS ROOM.

CAROL (OS)
Folks, please take your seats. The briefing will start now.

C.J. hears this, rushes in and takes the podium.

C.J.
Good morning everybody. I have to start with a sad announcement. Congressman
Grant Samuels
finally succumbed to pneumonia last night. His wife, Eileen, his son, Robert,
his daughters,
Priscilla and Patty, and his eight grandchildren are all in the President's
thoughts today.
I also want to talk this morning about the Bureau of Labor Statistics and
the Federal Housing
Administration.

The camera moves from C.J. to a set of monitors against the wall and it
switches to a TV set
in JOSH'S HOSPITAL ROOM, where Josh is lying in bed watching C.J.'s briefing.

C.J.
And as a special treat for our friend, Josh Lyman, who's recovering very
nicely at G.W.
The President's science advisors is telling us that psychics at Cal Tech
and the Fermi
National Accelerator Lab.....

Josh begins banging the back of his head against the headboard.

C.J. (OS)
You know what? I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be physicists.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	AUGUST 14TH
	12 WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY

TOBY [VO]
81%.

SAM [VO]
Can you believe it?

C.J. [VO]
And all we had to do was get shot at.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Everyone is seated a conference table.

TOBY
81%

SAM
Those numbers are soft.

C.J.
(sarcastically) Do you think?

SAM
You don't?

C.J.
A week ago the job approval's at 51. We get shot at and it's at 81. Yeah,
I think the numbers
are soft.

TOBY
Still... 81%.

Leo and Bartlet enter the room. Everyone stands up.

EVERYONE
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Good morning, everybody. Anybody know what the word 'acalculia' means?

SAM
It's the inability to form arithmetic functions. I'm sorry, Mr. President. You
wanted to
answer your own question, didn't you?

BARTLET
Yeah, but I'll get over it. [starts to sit down]

SAM
Good for you, sir. That's very mature.

BARTLET
Shut up.

SAM
You're not over it yet, are ya?

Everyone sits down.

BARTLET
No.

SAM
Okay.

LEO
Did we really poll at 81%?

C.J.
Those aren't internals. It's CNN, USA Today.

TOBY
It's soft.

LEO
(mock surprise) No!

SAM
When asked "whose approach on important national problems do you think is
generally best,
President Bartlet or the Republican leaders of Congress?" Bartlet gets 61%.

BARTLET
Well 19% of the country has clearly made up their minds about me; 20% just
feel sorry for me.
This is what you want if you're the leader of the free world. Give us an
over view.

ED
Mr. President, we got a honest to god shot at taking back the House.

LARRY
Taking back the house and possibly picking up two seats net in the Senate.

ED
As well as two governorships and maybe a half dozen state Houses.

LEO
Where should we be looking?

ED
Indiana 6th, California 4th and 14th...

LARRY
Michigan 12...

ED
Michigan 12, Texas 12...

LARRY
Florida 4, 5, and 9...

C.J.
They're not going to elect a democrat in the Florida 9th.

LARRY
I'm sorry Florida 8th.

LEO
They're not going to elect a democrat there, either. But let's put some time
into it.
What else?

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Charlie is on the phone and Margaret is hanging around Mrs. Landingham's
desk. Charlie is
trying to ignore her.

CHARLIE
(into phone) I can hold or you can call me back.

MARGARET
An inability to form arithmetic functions.

CHARLIE
(into phone) Sure.

MARGARET
Apparently, there's a specialized circuit in the brain for numbers. You know
where it is?

CHARLIE
(into phone) I'm sorry?

MARGARET
It's in the left parietal lobe.

CHARLIE
(into phone) Thank you.

MARGARET
Hey, Zoey.

ZOEY
[enters] Hey, Margaret. Where's Mrs. Landingham?

MARGARET
At a funeral. The President's in the Roosevelt room.

ZOEY
I wasn't here to see my father. I was here to see him. (indicates Charlie)

MARGARET
Do you know what 'acalculia' means?

ZOEY
Yes, because I got it at breakfast.

CHARLIE
(into phone) Thank you. (hangs up) Hey.

ZOEY
Hi.

MARGARET
Charlie, Mrs. Landingham asked me to ask you to call technical support and
have them look at
her computer.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

MARGARET
You're supposed to ask for a man named Andrew Mackintosh. He's the only one
she trusts.

CHARLIE
Mackintosh?

MARGARET
Like the apple.

CHARLIE
Sure.

MARGARET
Thank you.

Zoey and Charlie leave to the HALLWAY.

ZOEY
I called you at home last night.

CHARLIE
I didn't get home 'til late.

ZOEY
Where were you?

CHARLIE
I was here.

ZOEY
Called here, too.

CHARLIE
I'm not lying to you, Zoey.

ZOEY
I don't think you were lying to me, Charlie. I just think you were either
at home or here,
you didn't return my call.

CHARLIE
I was here, I didn't get the message. I was home, I got the message. I didn't
return your
call 'cause it was late.

ZOEY
I don't mind being woken up.

CHARLIE
Well, now I know that.

ZOEY
Now you know that.

CHARLIE
(to someone in the hall) Excuse me.

ZOEY
We have been dating for nine months.

CHARLIE
I've gotta go in there.

Charlie enters THE ROOSEVELT ROOM.

ED
Cumberland, Monroe, possibly Stanwick.

C.J.
Since you brought up Cumberland and Monroe, can I say a word about the
shooting?
(beat) It's been a week and the honeymoon's about to be over.

SAM
She's right.

C.J.
We want to be sure it doesn't look like we're taking advantage of the
situation.

TOBY
Why not?

C.J.
Why not, what?

TOBY
The entire country was the victim of domestic terrorism. Why not use the
soft numbers before
they disappear and go after the guns and go after the hate groups?

C.J.
It doesn't look good.

TOBY
Looks good to me.

C.J.
Well, you work for the White House, Toby. I think we were counting on your
support, either way.

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
C.J., if you get questions about the midterms, say "we haven't thought that
far ahead due to
recent events."

LEO
Oh, and when they ask about the linkage between the approval numbers and
the shooting,
"the President's deeply gratified by the publics' support but eager to focus
on the issues."

TOBY
Which will be....

BARTLET
I'll let you know. Thank you very much, everyone.

EVERYONE
Thank you, Mr. President.

Everybody rises as Bartlet stands up.

CHARLIE
Mr. President.

Charlie hands a note to Bartlet as everyone clears the room.

BARTLET
(reads the note) It's fine. Tell them around 3 o'clock.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Was Zoey out there?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Is she still here?

CHARLIE
I don't know, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. [starts to gather his files] Leo.

Leo and Bartlet walk out of the room to the HALLWAY.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Did you know Elliot Roush is running to for the school board in Manchester?

LEO
I didn't sir, but then, I don't know who Elliot Roush is...

BARTLET
Elliot Roush.

LEO
Yes.

BARTLET
My Elliot Roush.

LEO
I'm sorry sir, but I'm still not...

BARTLET
I beat him in my first Congressional campaign.

LEO
I can't believe I didn't commit that piece of arcane information to memory.

BARTLET
I want some polling numbers on that race.

LEO
I don't want you focusing your attention on the school board race in New
Hampshire.

BARTLET
Yeah, 'cause looking at two numbers on a piece of paper really takes the
life out of me.

LEO
I know where this is going...

BARTLET
Get me the numbers. Let me tell you something...

LEO
No.

BARTLET
...I'm ready to go out there.

LEO
No.

BARTLET
I don't need to wait another week.

LEO
Sir, let's play a game of "Who do you think I'm going to agree with?" Fourteen
doctors say
you should wait another week before you assume a campaign schedule. Who do
you think I'm
going to agree with?

BARTLET
Get away from me.

LEO
Yes, sir.

Leo leaves. Bartlet enters the Oval Office.

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

GINGER
Sam.

SAM
Is he here?

GINGER
Want me to bring him back?

SAM
Ah... I'll go get him myself.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Sam walks out to the White House lobby and sees a familiar person: TOM JORDAN.

SAM
Tom.

TOM JORDAN
Sam, hello.

SAM
I hope you weren't waiting too long.

They shake hands.

TOM
No. I mean, I don't mind. Sam, this is my wife, Sarah.

SARAH
Hi.

SAM
It's nice to meet you. You got married.

TOM
Two years, with a baby on the way.

SAM
(to Sarah) Is it his?

They all chuckle.

SARAH
Yeah.

SAM
Okay, follow me.

They all start walking.

SAM
Tom and I had a contracts professor at Duke who couldn't stand me.

TOM
Those may be your thoughts, Mr. Seaborn, but that's not the law.

SAM
If he knew how many times I wanted to tell him to take the law and shove it
up his...
Hey, have you guys been to the White House?

TOM
No.

SARAH
We were looking forward to a tour.

SAM
Ah...Well, that's my office over there. (points to his area)
And the President works in that round room over there. (points toward the
Oval Office)
And nobody else really matters. Come on in.

They go inside THE MURAL ROOM.

SAM
This is the Mural Room.

SARAH
Hmm...can you tell us anything about it?

SAM
It's called the Mural room. Have a seat. Do you know why I wanted to talk
to you?

Tom and Sarah sit down, but Sam stays standing.

TOM
I really don't.

SAM
'Cause the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee asked me to.
(beat) Grant Samuels died a few days ago.

TOM
Yeah, we saw it on the news.

SAM
He wasn't going to be running again anyways, 'cause he was pretty sick and
the man who was
going to be running in his place...

TOM
Seymour Worthen.

SAM
Right, isn't going to...

TOM
Sy Worthen isn't running?

SAM
Tom, you are a phenomenally attractive Democratic candidate for that
district. There are
162 games in major league baseball season and the players have a saying
"Every team's going
to win 54 games, every team's going to lose 54, it's what you do with the
other 54 games that
counts." In your district, you got democrats, you got republicans, and the
other 54 games
are women. Specifically young mothers, among who the number one issue is
crime. You are a
graduate of Oberlin and Duke Law School. You passed up many lucrative
opportunities to work
in the D.A's office. You are a prosecutor with an exceptional conviction
record and certainly
nobody can hang "soft on crime" around your neck. You're active in local
politics. You're
personable. You are articulate and energetic. You are married and you're
having a baby.

SARAH
I thought you didn't know that.

SAM
I'm sorry?

SARAH
When you were out in the lobby, it seemed as if you didn't know that Tom
was married and
that there was a baby on the way. And now it sounded like you already had
that information.

SAM
Sarah, there's very little information about your husband that I don't
have. And tell your
mom happy birthday for me.

Sarah blinks in dismay.

TOM
Sam.

SAM
Tom, you'll have the full weight of the Democratic National Committee,
the Congressional
Campaign Committee, the Minority leader, whom we hope to make the majority
leader, and the
President of the United States. What do you say? You want to run for Congress?

TOM
There's a lot to consider, Sam. How much time do I have to think about it?

SAM
Five minutes. I'll be outside. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
C.J. and Toby are walking down a hallway.

C.J.
You're pissed at me?

TOBY
I'm saying, I could've used your support in there.

C.J.
You get my support the same way I get yours. When I agree with what you're
saying or when I
don't care about what you're saying. This time I disagree.

TOBY
You don't think we should use the moment to get aggressive about guns and
hate groups?

C.J.
I think we were victims of a violent crime and it's unseemly to use this
moment at all.

TOBY
We didn't get the country drunk, C.J. We're not taking advantage of anybody,
and even if we
were, who cares?

C.J.
Every Republican spending the next 12 weeks trying to keep control of the
House.

TOBY
C.J.

C.J.
Toby! If you and the FBI want to go after hate groups, I'm not the one you
have to convince.
Go bag the President.

They go inside TOBY'S OFFICE. C.J. starts to leave, but turns back.

TOBY
I will.

C.J.
I've gotten a lot of calls about pieces people want to do on how staffers
are handling the
shooting and the aftermath.

TOBY
Psychologically?

C.J.
Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea. Do you?

TOBY
We're not the story.

C.J.
That's what I'm saying.

TOBY
Leave me alone.

C.J. leaves.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

	SEPTEMBER 5TH
	NINE WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY

INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Toby walks in.

TOBY
(to himself) I got it. I got it. I got it. (beat) I got it. Bonnie, Ginger,
I got it.

GINGER
Excellent!

BONNIE
Way to go!

TOBY
Sam!

BONNIE (OS)
Do you know what?

GINGER
No.

Toby enters his office and sets down some files and comes out of his office
looking for Sam.
Bonnie hands him a note, which he crumples without reading it.

TOBY
Sam.

He looks in Sam's office as Sam walks behind him.

TOBY
Sam?

SAM
I'm right here.

TOBY
[turns] Oh, I thought you were in there.

SAM
I wasn't.

TOBY
I got it.

SAM
Got what?

TOBY
How to avoid the appearance that we're randomly and generically going after
extremist groups
in violation of their civil liberties.

SAM
We can avoid that appearance by not doing it.

TOBY
Yes, or with this. The shooting was the action of not one, but at least
three card carrying
members of West Virginia White Pride.

They leave the communications office and down a yellow HALLWAY.

SAM
They have cards?

TOBY
What?

SAM
They actually have membership cards?

TOBY
What the hell? No, Sam, it was an expression.

SAM
Okay.

TOBY
The key phrase is "at least", at least three members. There might be more. We
don't know.

SAM
So, therefore, FBI has grounds to investigate...

TOBY
Yes, to investigate or curtail the activities of all extremist
organizations....

SAM
...under a cover of investigating this one particular crime.

TOBY
How do we know that whatever young Nazis of Delaware weren't co-conspirators?

SAM
It's not an uncommon way to get around the Bill of Rights, Toby. I'm surprised
it took you
three weeks to come up with it.

TOBY
Possibly, because, I had no help from anyone else who works in this building.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
I'm taking it to Leo.

SAM
Knock yourself out. (walks off)

Toby goes into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

TOBY
Donna.

He follows her as she weaves in and out of the bullpen.

DONNA
Yes?

TOBY
You going to see Josh?

DONNA
I'm taking him his lunch.

TOBY
Can I come?

DONNA
No.

TOBY
Listen...

DONNA
No.

TOBY
Donna.

DONNA
You know the rules.

TOBY
The rules are dumb.

DONNA
The rules are not dumb.

TOBY
Donna, seriously.

DONNA
I'm perfectly serious, Toby. He's recovering from an attempted murder. He's
supposed to be
resting and I don't want people going over there getting him fuhtushed.

TOBY
Fartoost. Don't bring the Yiddish unless you know what you're doing.

DONNA
You know what word should be Yiddish, but isn't?

TOBY
Donna

DONNA
Spatula.

TOBY
Thank you.

DONNA
Also, far-fetched.

TOBY
I need to talk to him about...

They go inside JOSH'S OFFICE.

DONNA
The Hate Crimes and how best to bring it to the President. He's got the
papers you wrote.
He's got the materials you sent him. You've talked to him on the phone 93
times a day.

TOBY
And I'd like to go to his apartment and talk to him.

DONNA
No.

TOBY
Donna.

DONNA
Maybe if you hadn't said the rules were dumb.

Donna walks out and leaves a dejected Toby in the office.

TOBY
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Zoey knocks on Leo's door frame.

ZOEY
Hey, Leo.

LEO
Hey, kid.

ZOEY
I was looking for my father.

LEO
He's making campaign calls.

ZOEY
He's not in the Office.

LEO
He's making them from the residence.

ZOEY
Why?

LEO
You're father has a very strict interpretation of something called the
Pendleton Act,
which prohibits campaign donations to be solicited on government property.

ZOEY
It's a little impractical for the President to step across the street to
use the pay phone,
isn't it?

LEO
Exactly.

ZOEY
Isn't the Residence government property, too?

LEO
Yes.

ZOEY
Then why....?

LEO
Because your father is a demented, demented man. I'm going over there.

They start to leave Leo's office.

ZOEY
Leo, these last few days, do you feel like Charlie's been....

LEO
No.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY
A steward is bringing breakfast for Bartlet, who is sitting on the bed with
a phone to
his ear. C.J. is standing at the end of the bed.

C.J.
Sir...

BARTLET
46%.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
The guy is polling at 46%.

C.J.
I didn't think they had polling data on people running for seats on the
Board of Education.

BARTLET
They didn't. I had to have our guys do it.

C.J.
Sir, do you think you're becoming obsessed with this race?

BARTLET
He's polling at 46%. He's not a joke. He's polling inside the margin.

C.J.
In a race for the Board of Education, in a school district that has 43 kids.

BARTLET
It has 1100 kids, and you don't take these people seriously 'cause they
don't get anywhere
nationally, but they don't have to. All they have to do is, bit by little bit,
get themselves
on the Boards of Education and city councils. 'Cause that's where all the
governing that
really matters to anybody really happens.

C.J.
We do a little governing here, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I'm on hold with a guy whose name I've got on an index card. How much
governing do you think
is going on around here today? And can you believe I'm on hold?

C.J.
You're not, sir. You finished the call.

BARTLET
I did?

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How'd it go?

C.J.
Very well.

Leo knocks at the door. He enters with Zoey.

LEO
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Elliot Roush is now polling at 46%.

LEO
How do you know?

BARTLET
I had our people...

LEO
You had our people check.

BARTLET
[gets up off the bed] I have 3 daughters who grew up in that school district.

LEO
Leave Elliot Roush alone. You beat him already.

BARTLET
And he has come back. Like crab grass pulled from the lawn. Not by the root,
but by the
other thing.

LEO
I stopped by to see how the calls are going.

BARTLET
They're going fine.

LEO
Then I'll leave.

Bartlet sits down at the settee to eat his breakfast.

BARTLET
Can't tell you how much I'm going to miss you. (to Zoey) You wanted to talk
to me?

ZOEY
Not if you're in this mood.

C.J. motions for Leo to wait.

BARTLET
(big sigh) This is real and a man, who makes the Spanish Inquisition look
like a Barbara
Walters Special, is now polling at 46% in your school district, for which
I have personally
baked things to raise money. (to C.J.) You can go, too.

C.J.
You baked things?

She's a bit amused by this information.

BARTLET
(sternly) You can go.

C.J.
(more seriously) Thank you, Mr. President.

C.J. and Leo leave.

BARTLET
What do you want?

ZOEY
Dad, can I speak to you about Charlie?

We follow C.J. and Leo just OUTSIDE THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM.

C.J.
The calls are going well.

LEO
Good.

C.J.
Listen, Leo, we're still asked to participate in aftermath stories.

LEO
Psychological effects?

C.J.
Yeah and I was wondering....

LEO
Don't do it.

C.J.
No, I know that. But I was wondering...

LEO
You're wondering what?

C.J.'s beeper vibrates and she checks it.

C.J.
This isn't going to be good.

LEO
You were wondering what?

C.J.
Don't worry about it.

LEO
Okay. (leaves)

C.J. picks up a nearby phone and starts dialing.

C.J.
(into phone) Hey, it's C.J. Cregg.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

TOBY
Step 3: Public disclosure of membership and contributor rolls for all
organizations on the
Attorney General's list of hate groups. This allows for the American public
to know who their
people are and where their funding is coming from.

SAM
Yes, and to do it in blatant violation of their right to free association.

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
You know, laws like this were passed in the south during the Civil Rights
movement to root
out members of such terrorist organizations as the NAACP.

TOBY
I knew you were going to say that.

SAM
Yes, you did. By the way, the Supreme Court struck down those laws as
unconstitutional.

TOBY
That was an ultra-activist Warren Court that struck down those laws and I
think they'd see it
differently, today.

SAM
Toby, you're an.... you're an activist!

TOBY
And I was shot at and so I am acting, right now!

C.J.
[walks up] Sam.

SAM
He wants everyone to have to register affiliation with the FBI.

C.J.
Any problems with the first Amendment?

TOBY
I'll get around them. [takes off]

C.J.
I need to talk to you.

SAM
What's up?

C.J.
There's a problem with your friend.

SAM
Which friend?

C.J.
Tom Jordan, the guy you got running.

SAM
What's the problem?

C.J.
His prosecutorial record.

SAM
His prosecutorial record is great.

C.J.
Not during jury selection.

They walk inside THE MURAL ROOM.

SAM
Preemptive challenges?

C.J.
Your friend likes white jurists for his black defendants.

SAM
He's a prosecutor, C.J.

C.J.
Not anymore. Now he's a politician and this needs a save. So, get into it,
would you?

SAM
Yeah.

C.J. leaves the Mural room and Sam stands alone looking around the room.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

	OCTOBER 2OTH
	THREE WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is at his desk stuffing papers into his briefcase getting ready to
leave.
Charlie is giving him last minute details.

BARTLET
Do we know how Tokyo opened?

CHARLIE
I thought it was up 3/8th against the Yen, but let me check with somebody.

BARTLET
Is that it for me?

CHARLIE
No, sir. You've got 4 to 5 phone calls still to make.

BARTLET
Wyman?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Frank Gates and McNamara?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Those are campaign calls.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, why don't you stay in your office and make the damn...

Charlie cuts off and realizes that he's gone too far. Bartlet takes off his
glasses and
looks pointedly at Charlie.

BARTLET
Because I choose not to, Charlie. Because, however an empty gesture it may
seem, I would
like to take some executive notice of the notion that it's probably not a
good idea for the
most powerful and influential person in the world to be calling up the people
whose laws
he signs and asking them for money! (beat) I'm going to do it, but not behind
this desk
and not in this room. What else?

CHARLIE
(hesitantly) I was asked to tell you that an event was added to Tuesday the
7th. A reception
for Talk Radio Host. I guess they're called Talk Radio. It's 3 weeks away. You
don't need to
commit right now.

BARTLET
Yeah. (takes the phone messages) I'll make these calls from the Residence. Tell
C.J. I want
to see her in an hour.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet leaves his office as Charlie thinks about what just happened.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT
Charlie is walking down the hall by the Roosevelt Room. He sees something
in the room that
catches his eye and enters.

CHARLIE
Hello. Are you a cabinet member?

At the end of the conference table is a little boy sitting in one of the
chairs.
The little boy shakes his head.

CHARLIE
Can you tell me your name?

JEFFREY
Jeffrey.

CHARLIE
Jeffrey what?

JEFFREY
Jeffrey Mackintosh.

CHARLIE
Like the apple.

JEFFREY
Yeah.

CHARLIE
You here with your dad?

On cue, ANDREW MACKINTOSH enters the room.

ANDREW MACKINTOSH
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Jeffrey, when I tell you to sit and stay put, do you
know what I need
you to do? That. I need you to do that. Not some variation on that, but that.

JEFFREY
Sorry.

ANDREW
Sorry. Okay, see now I gotta make you rewire the house. (to Charlie) I'm
Andrew Mackintosh.
I'm from Technical Support. We're installing new software.

CHARLIE
Yeah, I thought that was a few weeks ago.

ANDREW
It was, but there was some bugs.

CHARLIE
Okay.

ANDREW
I hope nobody minds. They said it was okay to bring my son. My wife works
some nights.

CHARLIE
Sure.

ANDREW
(to Jeffrey) Let's go big man.

Andrew pats Jeffrey and hustles him out of the room.

CHARLIE
Take it easy, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY
Take it easy.

Charlie walks out of the Roosevelt room and passes Sam in the HALLWAY.

SAM
Hey, man.

CHARLIE
Hey.

Sam walks towards LEO'S OFFICE.

SAM
Leo. (taps lightly on Leo's door frame)

LEO
Oh Sam, come in. Close the door.

SAM
What's going on?

LEO
Josh is on the speaker.

JOSH (VO)
Hey, Sam.

SAM
What's going on?

LEO
A guy who went to college with Tom Jordan says he belonged to an all white
fraternity.
The local papers are gonna carry it tomorrow.

SAM
Yeah. I checked that out weeks ago. It wasn't an exclusive fraternity,
they just didn't
happen to have any black pledges.

LEO
Yeah, but you put this together with the preemptive challenges in voir dire
and serious
leaders in the African-American community have a problem.

SAM
I'll talk to him.

LEO
Nah.

SAM
Leo.

LEO
No, it's over, Sam. I'm going to...

SAM
No.

LEO
I'm going to cancel....

SAM
No!

LEO
The President's stop and shut down the money.

SAM
You can't cut and run, Leo.

JOSH (VO)
We don't have any choice, Sam.

SAM
Of course we have a choice.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Josh is pacing around his apartment wearing a sweaty T-shirt.

JOSH
We got a chance at the House. We've only got 3 weeks left. Leo's got to put
the President
and the money where the President and money can win.

SAM
Tom Jordan is running against the man...

LEO
Well, you don't have to tell me.

SAM
You're going to hand it to him

JOSH
Which will matter less if we get back the house.

LEO
Jordan is down by 7 and he's not going to come back from this.

JOSH
Not only that, we stand by him, this is a national thing. It could drag down
black turn out
in districts where we're competitive.

SAM
I told him....

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
I told him we would stand by him. I told him he would have our full support. I
was the one
who asked him to run. I was asked to ask him.

LEO
I know.

SAM
We walk away now, that's it. He's a racist! The White House just said so!

LEO
We can't afford all the things we want, Sam. It's over.

Leo puts on his glasses and the conversation is over. Sam leaves and slams
the door on his
way out.

JOSH (VO)
Hey, Leo. You know, there's a... something called the Super string
Theory. Which at its most
basic level says that the universe consists of these tiny loops of string
that vibrate at
different frequencies.

Leo finds this information a bit inane.

LEO
How did that bullet not kill you?

JOSH
Just lucky, I guess.

LEO
Yeah.

He reaches over and pushes a button to hang up on Josh.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby is working at his desk. C.J. knocks and enters.

C.J.
Toby.

TOBY
(without looking up) Yeah.

C.J.
Any chance I can see an advanced copy of the President's remark for the Asia
Pacific?

TOBY
Um... what?

C.J.
Asia Pacific.

TOBY
I have a draft here. I'm going to rewrite it.

C.J.
I thought I was going to have it by the end of the day.

TOBY
The day's not over yet.

C.J.
You know, Toby. These pieces everyone wants to do on the psychological
aftermath of the
shooting for the White House staff, they had me thinking. Do you think there
might be a
psychological aftermath and we're not paying attention to it?

TOBY
C.J., I really don't have time to have this conversation.

C.J.
I'm saying, I think you should have this conversation with somebody.

TOBY
You think my problem is psychological?

C.J
I think you're Director of Communications and you've been ignoring
operational
responsibilities...

TOBY
That's crap.

C.J.
...So you can behave like the Director of the FBI.

TOBY
Well, I'm waiting for the Director of FBI to behave that way.

C.J.
Toby.

TOBY
I'm waiting for the Justice department to behave that way. I'm waiting for
Congress to
behave that way.

Charlie walks up.

TOBY
I'm waiting for the White House to behave that way!

C.J.
You want to lock up everybody with a white sheet?

TOBY
Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Who has a problem with that? Bring 'em to me, right
now. YES I DO!

Charlie, who has been standing quietly, finally knocks lightly on Toby's
door. C.J. turns
around.

C.J.
He's ready for me?

CHARLIE
In the Residence.

C.J.
Thank you.

Charlie leaves. C.J. turns to Toby.

C.J.
I'll be here for a while, so... whenever you can get me Asia Pacific.

TOBY
Give me an hour.

C.J. leaves. Toby sits and taps his pen on his desk, but we can see something
is definitely
bothering him.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet is sitting reading some papers. Knock on the door.

BARTLET
Come in.

C.J.
[enters and closes the door] Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hi, C.J.

C.J.
Charlie said you wanted to see me.

BARTLET
Yeah. Why has there been no press mentioned that the fact that Elliot Roush
was an opponent
of mine in New Hampshire?

C.J.
Elliot Roush is the man....?

BARTLET
He's running for a seat on the school board up in New Hampshire.

C.J.
Yes, sir. I'm sure it's gotten some local coverage. I can have the news
office run....

BARTLET
Why isn't it more than local?

C.J.
It's a school board seat.

BARTLET
It's a human interest story.

C.J.
Not a very interesting one.

BARTLET
I'm saying, if anyone in the Press Room wanted to do this story that I would
comment on the
record.

C.J. takes a seat across from Bartlet.

C.J.
Sir, the President can't publicly take sides in a local school board election.

BARTLET
Why can't he?

C.J.
Because it's not done, and it's not fair. It's personal and it's
irresponsible. It will
galvanize the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress will think you've
abandoned them,
that you don't care about winning back the House.

BARTLET
I don't care about winning back the House.

C.J.
Mr. President...

BARTLET
I don't care about winning back the House!

C.J.
Well, I don't believe that's true so let's just keep that between you and me.

BARTLET
C.J., I've known men of faith in my life. Towering men. Men of wisdom and
compassion.
Men of all faiths, of healing and peace. Pro choices, pro-life, Republican,
Democrat,
men and women of God. Elliot Roush... (long beat) ...is polling at 53%. He's
polling
at 53%. He's the front runner.

C.J.
Then that's the way it is. In a democracy, oftentimes, the other people win.

BARTLET
Yeah. It was just a thought, but I mean, obviously, you're right.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thanks.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

C.J. gets up and leaves. Bartlet goes back to reading his papers.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - STORMY NIGHT

	NOVEMBER 17TH
	ELECTION DAY

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

SAM
Ginger!

GINGER
They're still too close to call.

SAM
All twelve?

GINGER
Yes.

SAM
Hey, give me somebody in the Midwest, would ya? (speaking to a room full of
people)
I want to see everyone on telephones.

Sam looks around and realizes everyone is on the phones.

SAM
Okay, good...just like that.

He enters his office where his friend, Tom and Sarah Jordan, are waiting. Sam
is startled by
their presence.

SAM
God...Tom, Sarah... I'm sorry. I forgot, I was... I'm sorry, I'm late. I'm
glad you could
make it.

SARAH
It was no problem coming, Sam. Turns out there was really no reason for us
to stay in our
district on Election day.

SAM
Yeah, you've seen the exits. You're going to lose, Tom.

SARAH
No, Kidding.

SAM
Probably 58-42.

TOM
Yeah.

SAM
42% is a very respectable number.

SARAH
The district's 49% Democrat, Sam.

SAM
Well, we'll get them next time.

SARAH
Shut up.

TOM
Sarah.

SARAH
There's not going to be a next time! So, shut up! (beat) Not even a word
from the White House.
Not even a word.

SAM
That's how we do it.

SARAH
Sam, any time we have the opportunity in the future to screw you. Count on
getting screwed.

SAM
Good luck with the baby.

Lightning flashes outside Sam's office as Tom and Sarah leave.

CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
We get a look at the reception for the Radio Talk Show Hosts. The camera
pans down to two
radio guys talking to C.J., who is looking confused, if not bored out of
her mind.

RADIO GUY 1
No, no, that was K-talk on Minneapolis. You're thinking Slam 100, sir,
in the Great Lakes
region. "The number one station with the number one sound."

RADIO GUY 2
But, then it was classic rock.

RADIO GUY 1
Or at least what our program director thought was classic rock. Fleetwood Mac,
and what not.

RADIO GUY 2
Then they switched over to news and information back in '82?

RADIO GUY 1
'82, '83.

RADIO GUY 2
We started with "Drive Time", then went to the 4 hour format.

RADIO GUY 1
Say, is Howard showing up today?

C.J.
(waking up a bit) Stern.

RADIO GUY 1
I heard he was going to show up if Imus was coming and Imus wasn't showing
up if Howard was
coming.

RADIO GUY 2
By the way, I was "Dave in the Morning" before he was "Imus in the
Morning." But that's...
uh... water under the bridge.

C.J.
Isn't Don Imus in this 70's?

RADIO GUY 2
I believe so, yes.

C.J.
[chuckles] How are you "Dave in the Morning" before he was "Imus in the
Morning?"

RADIO GUY 2
(taking it seriously) It was a very painful. I don't like to talk about it.

C.J.
Okay. Fellas, I'm sorry, but it's Election Day and I need to check in with
the exit polls...

RADIO GUY 1
Sure.

C.J.
...and what not. Good meeting you both.

RADIO GUY 1
Good talking to you, C.J.

C.J. turns away as a woman in a green business suit walks in. Photographers
taking pictures
and flashbulbs going off all over the place. C.J. walks up to Carol.

C.J.
Who's that?

CAROL
Jenna Jacobs.

C.J.
That's Jenna Jacobs?

CAROL
Yeah. She changed her hair.

C.J.
[starts fluffing her hair] What's the latest?

CAROL
12 races too close to call. Thompson, Marinovich....

C.J.
I'm gonna go check.

C.J. leaves the reception but gets one last look at JENNA JACOBS.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet is sitting in his chair going over some papers. Toby enters after
knocking.

TOBY
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Toby, I'm drinking the most fantastic thing I've ever tasted in my life:
chocolate syrup,
cold milk, and seltzer. I know it sounds terrible, but trust me, I don't
know where this
has been all my life.

TOBY
It's called an egg cream, Mr. President. We invented it in Brooklyn.

BARTLET
In Brooklyn.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Not New England?

TOBY
There are some good things in this world not from New England, sir.

BARTLET
Toby, don't ever let me hear you say that again.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What's on your mind?

TOBY
Mr. President, I was thinking... I was thinking it might...

BARTLET
You want to take a leave of absence.

TOBY
I was thinking I might need some time off, yes sir.

BARTLET
That's no problem, Toby.

TOBY
Okay.

BARTLET
Not a problem at all.

TOBY
Thank you, sir. [turns to leave]

BARTLET
15 minutes.

Toby turns back around to face Bartlet.

BARTLET
It's time to get up off the mat, Toby.

TOBY
Sir, what's to wrong with having the Attorney General designate potentially...

BARTLET
Toby.

TOBY
...dangerous organizations that promote violent acts? I... I... understand
it's problematic.
Ah... uh... there'd be no judicial review, or legislative oversight, or even
for that matter
legal finding of fact, but... (big sigh) Okay... fine... fine... (choked up
with emotion)
Why does it feel like this? I've seen shootings before.

BARTLET
[rises from his chair] It wasn't a shooting, Toby. It was a lynching. They
tried to lynch
Charlie right in front of our eyes, can you believe that?

Bartlet puts on his glasses and roots around for a file and hands it to Toby.

TOBY
What's this?

BARTLET
Keyhole satellite photographs. It's the headquarters for West Virginia White
Pride
headquarters. It's a diner outside Blacksberg. Every night for the past 12
weeks,
I've picked up the phone and called the Attorney General, fully prepared to
say two
wordstake 'em. And then I hang up the phone because I know it'll be better
tomorrow
and better the day after that. We saw a lynching, Toby. That's why it feels
like this.

TOBY
I'm not sure I'm going to come out of the other side of this.

BARTLET
I'm not sure I can either. But until we are sure, I think we should keep
coming into work
every day. [sits back down]

TOBY
How's it going with your school board guy?

BARTLET
Yeah, he's gonna win.

TOBY
When you ran against him, how'd you beat him?

BARTLET
I don't remember. I've been thinking about it for weeks, but I honestly
don't remember.

Knock at the door and Sam enters.

SAM
Excuse me, Mr. President. Good evening.

BARTLET
Hey, Sam.

SAM
I wasn't sure whether you'd be stopping by the Talk Radio reception. I
scratched out a few
remarks for you.

BARTLET
Let me look at them while we walk. Toby, go with us, to this radio thing.

TOBY
Oh God, really sir?

BARTLET
There'll be crab puffs. New England crab puffs, by the way, made in New
England.

SAM
Actually, it's Alaskan crab.

TOBY
Sam.

BARTLET
There's Alaskan crab in this White House?

TOBY
He wouldn't have known the difference.

BARTLET
Have you tried them?

SAM
I... yes, reluctantly. I think it was clear the way I ate the crab puffs
that it was a gesture
of protest.

BARTLET
Were they good?

SAM
Extraordinarily good and going very fast.

BARTLET
Let's get there.

Thunder rumbles outside.

CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
A waiter walks by with a platter of crab puffs. Photographers taking pictures
of various
guests. The camera pans up to C.J. talking with another radio personality.

GARY
I call myself Gary with a "G".

C.J.
How else would you spell "Gary"?

GARY
No other way. I'm saying, that's what I call myself. Therefore, "Gary with a
"G", talking to
you on KADR AM."

C.J.
Like Liza with a "Z".

GARY
Exactly. Hokey? Maybe so, but I have 900,000 listeners in the Rocky Mountain
region.

A Secret Service Agent catches C.J.'s eye.

C.J.
Would you excuse me?

C.J. leaves Gary with a "G" and makes her way into the center of the room
to introduce the
President.

C.J.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. The President of the
United States.

Everyone stands and claps. The flashbulbs go off as Bartlet enters the
reception.

BARTLET
Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thanks a lot. I wish I could spend more
than a few minutes
with you but the polls don't close in the east for another hour and there
are plenty of
election results left to falsify.

Everyone chuckles.

BARTLET
You know with so many people participating in the political and social debate
through call
in shows, it's a good idea to be reminded...

Bartlet loses his train of thought when something attracts his attention. The
camera pans over
to Jenna Jacobs, sitting on her chair.

BARTLET
...it's a good idea to be reminded of the awesome impact... the awesome
impact...

He finally gives up and addresses her.

BARTLET
I'm sorry, um... you're Dr. Jenna Jacobs, right?

JENNA JACOBS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
It's good to have you here.

JENNA JACOBS
Thank you.

BARTLET
The awesome impact of the airwaves and how that translates into the furthering
of our national
discussions but obviously also how it can... how it can...

He sighs, and addresses Jenna Jacobs again.

BARTLET
Forgive me, Dr. Jacobs. Are you an M.D.?

JENNA JACOBS
Ph.D.

BARTLET
A Ph.D.?

JENNA JACOBS
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
In Psychology?

JENNA JACOBS
No sir.

BARTLET
Theology?

JENNA JACOBS
No.

BARTLET
Social work?

JENNA JACOBS
I have a Ph.D. in English Literature.

BARTLET
I'm asking, 'cause on your show, people call in for advice and you go by
the name of
Dr. Jacobs on your show. And I didn't know if maybe your listeners were
confused by that,
and assumed you had advanced training in Psychology, Theology, or health care.

JENNA JACOBS
I don't believe they are confused, no sir.

BARTLET
Good. I like your show. I like how you call homosexuality an abomination.

JENNA JACOBS
I don't say homosexuality is an abomination, Mr. President. The Bible does.

BARTLET
Yes, it does. Leviticus.

JENNA JACOBS
18:22

BARTLET
Chapter and verse. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had
you here.
I'm interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned
in Exodus 21:7.
(small chuckles from the guests) She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent
Italian, and
always clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for
her be? While
thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, LeoO McGarry,
insists on working
on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I
morally obligated
to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's really
important,
'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching the skin of a
dead pig makes
us unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington
Redskins
still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point? Does the whole town
really have to be
together to stone my brother, John, for planting different crops side by
side? Can I burn
my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two
different threads?

Jenna Jacobs fidgets uncomfortably.

BARTLET
Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may be
mistaking this
for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building,
when the President
stands, nobody sits.

Jenna Jacobs squirms in her seat but doesn't rise. Bartlet glares meaningfully
at her.
She finally rises out of her seat.

BARTLET
Toby.

TOBY
Yes, Mr. President.

BARTLET
That's how I beat him.

Bartlet leaves the reception. Toby and Jenna Jacobs exchange glances before
Toby leaves.
Sam approaches her, who is holding a plate of hors d'oeuvre.

SAM
I'm just... I'm gonna take that crab puff.

Sam snatches up a crab puff off of her plate and leaves. She smiles awkwardly
around.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
Camera shot of a TV monitor and pans up to Charlie walking toward his desk.

JEFFREY (OS)
You want one of my animal crackers?

Jeffrey is sitting in Mrs. Landingham's chair.

JEFFREY
I have elephants and I have lions.

ANDREW
[enters] You bugging the man?

CHARLIE
No, we're okay. Is there a software problem again?

ANDREW
I think I got it. Just want to run a few programs and then I'll be out of
here.
(sits down) Pretty busy day around here, huh?

CHARLIE
Yeah. My name is Charlie Young, by the way.

ANDREW
You don't think I don't know who you are? Man who almost got the President
killed?

CHARLIE
Yeah. That's going to look good on my resume.

ANDREW
I'll just be a minute.

Lightning flashes outside.

CHARLIE
My mother used to work nights, too.

ANDREW
I'm sorry?

CHARLIE
My mother used to work nights, too.

ANDREW
Was she a nurse?

CHARLIE
A police officer.

ANDREW
Is she gone?

CHARLIE
She was shot and killed in the line a year ago, June. Ironically, she wasn't
supposed to be
on the shift. She switched shifts that day 'cause I asked her to.

Long pause as they look at each other.

ANDREW
Hey, Charlie... um... you know what I think she'd say if she was here,
right now?

CHARLIE
What?

ANDREW
Same thing my father would say, "if they're shooting at you, you know you're
doing
something right."

CHARLIE
Yeah. (beat) Yeah. (more lightening flashes and rumbles) ...yeah.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT
Zoey is sitting in a chair on a balcony, reading a book. Charlie approaches
her.

CHARLIE
Excuse me, aren't you Zoey Bartlet?

Zoey gives a small smile and gets up to kiss Charlie

ZOEY
It's too much to happen to someone your age. Your father and your mother
and then this...
I don't know, Charlie. I mean... what do you do?

CHARLIE
I was going to go vote.

ZOEY
I could come.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

Leo walks by.

LEO
Hi.

ZOEY
Hi, Leo.

LEO
Charlie, I'm looking for the President.

CHARLIE
Is there anything wrong?

LEO
No, no... I... um.... I think he may have done a couple of numbers at the
Talk Radio reception.

CHARLIE
Okay. Zoey and I are going out. I'll be on my pager.

LEO
You're going out?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

LEO
Charlie, you're taking extra protection, right?

Charlie is a bit taken aback by that suggestion.

CHARLIE
Hey, Leo....

LEO
Secret Service protection, Charlie. But thanks for loading me up with that
image.

CHARLIE
Yeah, we'll have extra protection.

LEO
Okay. Something about a dead pig's skin. I need to find him.

Leo walks away as Charlie and Zoey looks confusingly at each other.

CUT TO: EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT STOOP - NIGHT
In a tree lined sidewalk, C.J., Josh and Donna are sitting on a stoop of
one of the townhouses
lining the sidewalk. Sam is nearby in a car talking on his cell phone.

SAM
(into phone) Okay.

Toby comes out of Josh's apartment and hands C.J. a bottle of beer.

JOSH
Everybody should have to stay inside for three months so that they truly
appreciate the
outdoors. I appreciate the outdoors, now. I'm an outdoorsman.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
I said I'd let you outside if you'd stop talking about being an outdoorsman
and if you
stopped talking about Theoretical Physics.

JOSH
(to C.J.) Aha! You'd thought I'd forget about it, didn't you? Banner headline,
5 days ago.
Model for the Unified Theory solved. Banner headline in the New York Times. You
said it wasn't
going to be news.

C.J.
Hey! You're wearing my pajamas.

JOSH
Yes, I am.

C.J.
Take your coat off, let's see.

Josh stands up and shrugs off his coat to reveal oversized light blue pajamas
that are three
sizes too big.

C.J.
Those are too big.

JOSH
Yes, they are. All this time I've been working with you, did you also think
I was playing
power forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers?

C.J.
I think they look good on you. (grabs Toby's arms)

TOBY
I think you're all freaks.

Sam gets off the phone and out of the car and approaches the stoop.

TOBY
What do you have?

SAM
You're not going to believe it.

C.J.
How'd they go?

SAM
Twelve races, in none of them did the incumbent win. In none of them, did
the party that
previously held the seat win. You know how it went? Seven to five.

JOSH
You're kidding.

C.J.
Seven republicans and five democrats?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
The house stayed the same?

Everyone looks at each other.

JOSH
After four months and 400 million dollars, everything stayed the same.

SAM
Yup.

JOSH
Tell me democracy doesn't have a sense of humor. We sit here, we drink this
beer out here
on the stoop, in violation about 47 city ordinances. I don't know, Toby,
it's election night.
What do you say about a government that goes out of its way to protect even
citizens that try
to destroy it?

TOBY
God bless America.

SAM
(beat) God bless America.

C.J.
God bless America.

DONNA
God bless America.

JOSH
God bless America.

They all clink their bottles before the camera pulls away from the stoop.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
