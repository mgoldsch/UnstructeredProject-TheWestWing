TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
Police cars, motorcycles and limousines arrive. Sirens are heard everywhere.

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Charlie are in one of the limos.

BARTLET
He wants to meet with me on the way back?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
On the way back?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
The Assistant Energy Secretary is flying to Portland in the middle of the
night so he
can meet with me on Air Force One on the way back?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
The day-to-day experience of my life has changed in many ways since taking
this job.

CHARLIE
I would imagine, sir.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BUS - CONTINUOUS
At the end of the motorcade, C.J. is sitting in front of the press bus,
facing the many
reporters who are accompanying Bartlet on the trip.

C.J.
Before we get on the plane, let me give you a couple of additions to the
passenger
manifest. Gerald Wegland, the Assistant Energy Secretary, is now on the
flight, as
well as Mr. Latham, the head of The White House Military Office, or WHAMO,
as we have
apparently taken - over my strong objection - to calling it. [Reporters
giggle.]
Also, on this evening's trip are Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn
and,
well, me.

DANNY
I thought you weren't going on the trip.

C.J.
I am now going on the trip.

DANNY
Are you being punished?

C.J.
I'm not being punished, I'm going on the trip.

DANNY
If the whole bus goes off the record, will you tell us why you're going on
the trip?

C.J.
[watches everyone carefully] I made fun of Notre Dame.

REPORTERS
Oh! Aww! Man! No!

C.J.
I usually get away with it!

KATIE
They're playing Michigan tomorrow.

C.J.
I know that now.

DANNY
You can't bring that stuff when they're playing Michigan.

C.J.
Well, I'll have a lot of time to think about that on the midnight ride to
Portland,
Danny. The wheels-up is 905. We'll touch down in Portland a little before
midnight
local time.

CUT TO: EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT
Leo approaches Bartlet's limo. Engines roar nearby.

LEO
Mr. President?

BARTLET
How're you doing?

LEO
I just got off with Bruno and Hess.

BARTLET
I'm sorry?

LEO
I said I just got off with Bruno and Hess.

BARTLET
You didn't say 'Michigan sucks'?

LEO
No, sir.

BARTLET
I thought you said 'Michigan sucks.'

LEO
No, sir. We're standing pretty close to the engines so it may have sounded
like I said,
'Notre Dame is gonna get the ass-kicking they so richly deserve.' Bruno and
Hess?

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
We stopped the tanker in the Gulf.

BARTLET
Whose?

LEO
It's Cyprus-flagged but they tracked them coming out of Qais.

BARTLET
You think they've got oil?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
We gonna board them?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
Anything else I should know?

LEO
No, sir.

BARTLET
I'll see you tomorrow night.

LEO
Have a good flight, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you!

C.J. approaches from the side, Leo waves to her and leaves.

BARTLET
Hey, C.J.!

C.J.
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I think it's great you decided to make the trip.

C.J.
I believe I was ordered to, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Yes. I remember now. You made one of your funny, funny jokes.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Put it on.

C.J.
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Put it on.

C.J.
Sir, I'm wearing Max Mara. It's going to break up the...

BARTLET
Put it on!

C.J. puts on the Notre Dame cap and grins at the officer in front of the
plane door.

C.J.
Please let nobody see me like this.

BARTLET
Hey, photo op.

C.J.
Oh good god.

They turn to the people below the plane and wave. Bartlet - enthusiastically,
C.J. - barely.

BARTLET
Let's hit the sky!

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Josh is sitting at his desk.

JOSH
Did he look tired?

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Leo is sitting inside. He is on the phone in the car.

LEO
No, he looked fine.

JOSH
You told him about the tanker?

LEO
Yeah. I wish he'd cancel the event, it's a long flight.

JOSH
He likes long flights, he gets to talk to everybody and think out loud.

LEO
Yeah, but then he lands.

JOSH
Yeah, so... well, then he lands. [beat] Anyway, I'm going to meet with Matt
Skinner.

LEO
Tonight?

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
He's gonna say the language in the bill doesn't prohibit.

JOSH
Yeah, but it creates a Federal Definition.

During this conversation, Donna, wearing a stunning red dress, comes in,
turns off
Josh's PC and laptop, picks up his feet to collect papers from his desk and
flicks
off the table lamp.

LEO
Still, at the State level...

JOSH
Yeah. Are you sticking around tonight?

LEO
The President's going to have to make a decision from the plane.

JOSH
Okay. I have to go. Donna is about to cease the phone.

LEO
All right.

JOSH
Leo. He likes long plane rides.

LEO
Yeah. Josh hangs up the phone.

JOSH
Can I have the electricity back on?

DONNA
No.

She walks out of the office to JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. Josh follows.

JOSH
Why not?

DONNA
It's time to go.

JOSH
Not for me. Matt Skinner's coming down from the Hill.

DONNA
[turns to Josh] When did this happen?

JOSH
Two minutes ago. Did you have plans?

DONNA
Did I have plans!

JOSH
Did you?

DONNA
Look at me!

Josh looks.

JOSH
Hey, you look GOOD!

DONNA
Yes, I do!

She walks away. Josh follows again.

JOSH
You weren't wearing that during the day today.

DONNA
Pity the girl who tries to get something past you, Josh.

JOSH
Did you steal that dress?

DONNA
I bought this dress.

JOSH
But you're returning it tomorrow.

DONNA
Yes, I am.

JOSH
That's stealing!

DONNA
I'm giving it back.

JOSH
After wearing it once.

DONNA
There's a word for this.

JOSH
It's "stealing"!

DONNA
[puts on her coat] I'm a girl on a budget, Josh. I'm being thrifty.

JOSH
And felonious. What are your plans?

DONNA
Look...

JOSH
What are your plans?

DONNA
We're having drinks, we're having dinner, we are going dancing, we are having
dessert.

JOSH
No problem. You can do all those things except for the drinks, the dancing,
and the
dessert.

DONNA
Josh...

JOSH
I need you to be done with dinner in an hour and five minutes.

DONNA
[shows him her dress again] Do you see what I'm wearing?

JOSH
If you wanna have sex, you'd better do it during dinner.

DONNA
[walks closer to him] This is the guy, Josh. This is a great guy. His name
is Todd.

JOSH
[smiling goofily] You met him for five minutes at a party.

DONNA
I got the good vibe.

JOSH
Okay. [turns back to his office]

DONNA
I have an excellent sense about these things!

JOSH
[turns back, yelling] Actually, you have NO sense about these things! You
have no vibe,
you have terrible taste in men, and your desire to be coupled up will always
and forever
drown out any small sense of self or self-worth that you may have.

DONNA
[as her smile fades and about to cry] You're a downer, you know that? I'm
calling you
Deputy Downer from now on!

She leaves the bullpen. Josh watches her go. Then walks to his office.

JOSH
Be back by the time I'm done with Skinner!

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
Sam is sitting in a chair, looking nowhere. He's holding his speech carelessly
in
his hand.

PILOT [via P.A.]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck. We're just passing
through
20,000 feet en route to our cruising altitude of 38,000 feet. Our flight
plan this
evening will take us over Pittsburgh and Cleveland, passing 190 miles south
of the
University of Notre Dame, then over Radic City, South Dakota; Casper, Wyoming,
to...

During the announcement, Sam jumps suddenly, and walks into a CABIN where
Toby is
sitting in an armchair.

SAM
Toby?

TOBY
Let me see it.

SAM
Could I talk to you a second?

TOBY
Is it done?

SAM
It... it's not... it's not good. It's not going well.

TOBY
We've had meetings...

SAM
Yeah, Toby...

TOBY
For the past three weeks!

SAM
I'm not confused about policy.

TOBY
What's the problem?

SAM
I'm not writing well. I'm just... I'd rather not distribute this to the pool
yet.

The steward walks into the cabin.

STEWARD
Mr. Ziegler, Mr. Seaborn, do you know what you'd like for dinner?

TOBY
[gets up] We'll be eating in the conference room. I'll have a club sandwich,
Jack Daniels
and ice.

STEWARD
Mr. Seaborn?

SAM
Nothing for me.

TOBY
You have to have something.

SAM
I'm fine. [He looks horrible.]

TOBY
[to the steward] Bring him a club sandwich.

STEWARD
Yes, sir.

They walk out of the room. C.J. is coming down the stairs to meet them.

TOBY
Nice hat.

C.J.
Shut up!

TOBY
[beat] Sam and I are going to work for a little bit, you'll have draft copies
to
distribute to the press in about three hours.

C.J.
It was already distributed.

SAM
W-what do you mean?

C.J.
It was already distributed.

SAM
You have to get it back!

C.J.
I can't get it back.

SAM
C.J....

C.J.
They know you're polishing it...

SAM
I'm doing more than polishing it, C.J., you've got to get it back!

C.J.
I'll tell them there's a new draft and then you should...

SAM
You've got to get the old draft back!

C.J.
They're not going to read it!

SAM
They might.

C.J.
So what?

SAM
It's very bad writing and it's got my fingerprints all over it!

C.J.
[laughs] Sam!

TOBY
C.J., try to get it back. [walks past them, to Sam] C'mon.

STEWARD
Ms. Cregg, do you know what you'd like for dinner?

SAM
[pops up on extreme right, whispers] Try to get it back?

C.J.
Uh... yeah.

STEWARD
Ms. Cregg, you know what you'd like for dinner?

C.J.
[walking] We've got pasta... salad?

STEWARD
It's good.

C.J.
I'll take it.

Bartlet and Charlie approach C.J.

BARTLET
C.J.!

C.J.
Mr. President.

BARTLET
What does the island of Qais mean to you?

C.J.
[rolls her eyes, walks by him] I know it's known as a rendezvous point for
Iraqi oil
smugglers.

BARTLET
About two hours ago we stopped a Cyprus-flagged ship called "The Nicosia." We
believe
it to be carrying petroleum products out of Iraq, in violation of UN
sanctions.

C.J.
What do we do when that happens?

BARTLET
We board the stip, we test a sample of the oil, we determine its point of
origin and
if it's black-market, the oil company gets fined.

C.J.
Don't they also get to sell the oil?

BARTLET
Yes.

C.J.
Doesn't the profit of the sale exceed the fine?

BARTLET
It dramatically exceeds the fine! So what do you think we should do?

C.J.
If you're going to have sanctions, have sanctions. There should be genuine
disincentive.

BARTLET
I agree. Charlie?

CHARLIE
[hands C.J. some papers] Here you go.

C.J.
What's this?

CHARLIE
The lyrics to the Notre Dame fight song.

BARTLET
It would please me if you would lead the press in a rendition as we pass
over South Bend.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
All five verses, please.

C.J.
[clutches her fists] Go Irish!

BARTLET
You bet your ass!

Bartlet and Charlie walk away as C.J. stands still with her fist still
clutched.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Ainsley, with a fan in her hand, walks into the cafeteria.

WAITER
Yes, ma'am?

AINSLEY
Yes, could I have a chocolate chip muffin, a can of Fresca and a bag of ice,
please?

WAITER
We don't have Fresca.

AINSLEY
Really?

WAITER
No, ma'am.

AINSLEY
You should really have Fresca.

WAITER
Yes, ma'am.

LEO
[comes up to Ainsley] Ainsley!

AINSLEY
Good evening, Leo!

LEO
What's with the fan?

AINSLEY
I just went and got it from my apartment. [picks up food and they walk to
exit]

LEO
It's seventeen degrees outside.

AINSLEY
Then I should move my desk outside, because it's a hundred and three in my
office.

LEO
The heat's not working?

AINSLEY
No, the heat's working great, I can vouch for that personally.

LEO
Okay.

They walk in different directions.

AINSLEY
You should really have Fresca in the building!

LEO [OS]
I'll get right on that!

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Congressman Matt Skinner knocks on his office door. He is a short,
neatly-dressed good
looking man in his thirties.

JOSH
Hey, Matt.

SKINNER
You let Donna out? [They shake hands.]

JOSH
Temporarily. She's having dinner.

SKINNER
Oh, with who?

JOSH
I guy she has no future with.

SKINNER
Why no future?

JOSH
Because I say so. You want some coffee or something?

SKINNER
Uh... you got a beer?

JOSH
Yeah. [gets two bottles from the refrigerator] It's too bad this is going
to be rushed.

SKINNER
Sorry?

JOSH
It's too bad we're talking about this for the first time right now.

SKINNER
I would have thought that was by design.

JOSH
Really?

SKINNER
Ten days are up tomorrow.

JOSH
We know.

SKINNER
We know you know. [Josh and Skinner sit down.] Josh, the language doesn't
prohibit
same-sex marriage.

JOSH
Of course it does.

SKINNER
It ensures that, for the purposes of Federal programs...

JOSH
That government will define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

SKINNER
That's right, while doing nothing to prohibit gay marriage on a state level.

JOSH
While doing nothing to prohibit it?

SKINNER
If you look at the language...

JOSH
Matt.

SKINNER
Yeah?

JOSH
When this bill was being discussed on the floor, there were some very ugly
things said
about homosexuals.

SKINNER
Yes.

JOSH
They were said by members of your own party. In fact, they were said by one
of the guys
who escorted you here tonight, who's sitting out in the lobby.

SKINNER
Yes, they were.

JOSH
You support this bill?

SKINNER
Yes, I do.

JOSH
Congressman... you're gay!

SKINNER
Yes, I am.

They look at each other, and Skinner smiles.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo enters as a Navy officer MARK CHASE is waiting for him.

LEO
What's going on, Mark?

MARK CHASE
The Sudanese captain of the tanker refused to let the Navy personnel on
board.

LEO
Oh, man.

MARK
CH-47 Seahawk helicopter was dispatched from the destroyer 'USS Monterey.' The
copter
tried to land, but seamen obstructed the deck with freight.

LEO
What else did they obstruct the deck with?

MARK
They fired warning shots.

LEO
From what?

MARK
Russian-made Kalashnikovs.

LEO
AK-47s.

MARK
Yes, at which point the Seahawk retreated to its carrier group.

LEO
Where are we now?

MARK
Central Command's going to have two F-18s buzz the ship, fire warning shots
over the bow.

LEO
There's no way this ends well. In fact, its' already over.

MARK
It's not over yet.

LEO
Trust me. I'll call the President. [walks out]

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Margaret enters Leo's office, stands by his desk, and looks at him.

LEO
Yeah?

MARGARET
You have a phone call.

LEO
From whom?

MARGARET
Can I just say that all I meant before was that if I was married and got
divorced and
my divorce papers came and I was an alcoholic, I would want to be...

LEO
Who's on the phone?

MARGARET
The President.

LEO
[gives her a glare, picking up phone quickly] Yes, sir?

BARTLET [VO]
What's our goal?

LEO
I'm sorry, sir?

BARTLET
What are we trying to do?

LEO
We're trying to seize the ship and escort it to Bahrain.

BARTLET
All right. The F-18 pilots?

LEO
They fire warning shots, maybe take out the propeller...

BARTLET
Leo, just so they know--it's a tanker full of crude oil. If they miss the
propeller and
hit something else---

LEO
They know. Excuse me, Mr. President. [whispering to Margaret] Would you stop
looking at
me like that?

Margaret turns and leaves quickly.

BARTLET
What was that?

LEO
Margaret was giving me a look.

BARTLET
Why?

LEO
My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink

Bartlet is in his cabin, talking on the phone.

	VALHALLA VECTOR - JET ROUTE 23
	WHEELING, WEST VIRGINIA

BARTLET
I didn't know that.

LEO
Don't worry about it, Mr. President. I'll keep you posted.

BARTLET
Okay. Why don't I have a final draft of tomorrow morning's...?

LEO
Toby and Sam are working on it.

BARTLET
What's wrong with it?

LEO
Sam doesn't like the writing.

BARTLET
Sam wrote it.

LEO
He's taking another swing.

BARTLET
All right. [hangs up]

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
Sam and are Toby working on the speech.

TOBY
Read it to me.

SAM
[reading] 'I'm calling on all Americans, young and old, Democrat and
Republican,
or none of the above, to make education a national priority.'

TOBY
Okay.

SAM
[sighing] "None of the above." It's a pedestrian phrase and has no
place. [crosses it out]

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Also when was education not a national priority before?

TOBY
Right. [clearing throat] It's an easy fix. All we need to do is...

SAM
No.

TOBY
No what?

SAM
No, it's not an easy fix.

TOBY
Sam?

SAM
This should...

TOBY
Yeah?

SAM
Oratory should raise your heart rate. Oratory should blow the doors off the
place. We
should be talking about not being satisfied with past solutions, we should
be talking
about a permanent revolution.

TOBY
[pausing and thinking] Where have I heard that?

SAM
Permanent revolution?

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
[darkly] I got it from a book.

TOBY
What book?

SAM
The Little Red Book.

TOBY
You think we should quote Mao Tse-tung?

SAM
We do need a permanent revolution.

TOBY
Still, I think we'll stay away from quoting Communists.

SAM
You think a Communist never wrote an elegant phrase?

TOBY
Sam...

SAM
How do you think they got every to be Communist?

TOBY
[sighing] Let's take a walk.

SAM
Toby, you're the one for the last six months who's been saying we need a
radical
approach...

TOBY
[raising his voice] Yes, yes I have, and I got shouted down in every
meeting! I'd love
to write a speech about a radical new approach to education, but we don't
have one! So
unless we can come up with an idea and implement it before land in Portland,
I'd prefer
not to paint a picture in the interest of great oratory. [sighs] Let's take
a walk.

SAM
Can't great oratory inspire an idea that can be implemented?

TOBY
We had six months. We're not doing it half-assed, we're not doing it
tonight. Let's go.

SAM
Where?

TOBY
Up and down the plane, get the blood flowing.

SAM
Mao knew how to get the blood flowing.

TOBY
Let's go.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
Donna enters the West Wing. Leo joins her, walking.

LEO
Hey, Donna.

DONNA
Good evening.

LEO
That's a nice dress.

DONNA
Thank you, sir.

LEO
You weren't wearing that dress earlier today, were you?

DONNA
You guys are sharp as tacks, you know that?

LEO
Did you have a date?

DONNA
Yeah.

LEO
With who?

DONNA
It doesn't matter.

LEO
Where'd ya eat?

DONNA
Phoebe's.

LEO
Ah, good. You know what you get there? Tell Dario, the chef, that you work
for me and
that you want flash-seared escolar with foie gras butter and a fresh juniper
berry
gravlax on a bed of shaved fennel. You have a nice '87 Petrus with
that. [beat]
What did you have?

DONNA
Two whiskey sours and a bowl of soup.

LEO
Ah, okay.

DONNA
I should tell Josh I'm back.

LEO
He's in the mess.

DONNA
Thanks. Hey, Leo. I hope you don't mind. [clears throat] Margaret mentioned
that your
divorce...

LEO
Oh, come on.

DONNA
She mentioned the papers came today...

LEO
Yeah.

DONNA
And she was worried that maybe...

LEO
Margaret worries if the sun is gonna rise. Go check in with Josh.

DONNA
Okay. He's in the mess?

LEO
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE MESS - NIGHT
Josh and Matt are in the mess, talking over a few beers.

SKINNER
It passed.

JOSH
I know.

SKINNER
It passed the Senate...

JOSH
I know, man.

SKINNER
With 85 votes. 29 Democrats voted for it. It passed the House with 342
votes. Our polling
numbers are the same as yours. 60% of Americans oppose legally sanctioned
gay marriage.
The people want the bill. Congress wants the bill. The President needs to
sign the bill.

JOSH
Public opinion can be wrong, Matt. The public opposed interracial marriage
and school
integration. You want me to reach back into the nostalgia file?

SKINNER
That's entirely different.

JOSH
[exasperated] How's it different?

SKINNER
The government has a responsibility to protect the rights of minorities,
but it can't
impose the minority's values on the majority.

JOSH
Freedom of choice isn't a minority value just because the majority doesn't
agree with
the minority's choice.

DONNA
[enters] Excuse me.

JOSH
Hey.

DONNA
I'm back.

SKINNER
Hey, Donna.

DONNA
Hey, Congressman.

SKINNER
How was your date?

DONNA
Uh, it was good. Josh, I'll be around.

JOSH
Thanks.

Donna exits, Matt and Josh watch her leave.

SKINNER
Josh, all the Marriage Recognition Act does is ensure that a radical social
agenda isn't
thrust upon an entire country that isn't ready for it yet.

JOSH
32 States have passed laws banning same-sex marriage. The States are doing
a fine job
protecting themselves from a radical social agenda without a federal shield.

SKINNER
Josh...

JOSH
I like you guys who want to reduce the size of government and make it just
small enough
so it can fit in our bedrooms!

SKINNER
When do you have to call the President?

JOSH
[glancing at his watch] I got time.

SKINNER
[loosening his tie] Let's have another beer.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESS AREA - NIGHT
C.J. taps Carol on the shoulder, adjusts her Notre Dame cap, and enters the
press seating.

C.J.
How's everybody doing?

STEVE
C.J., why'd the flight take off so late?

C.J.
We took off on time.

STEVE
No, I mean why was it scheduled late? I'm doing a side-bar.

C.J.
I'm not sure. The President had a budget meeting earlier, maybe they were
expecting it
to run long, I'll find out. Listen, I'd like you to give me back the draft
copies of the
morning education speech. We're going to replace them.

REPORTER
Why the change?

C.J.
Toby and Sam are doing some work.

STEVE
Is there a policy shift?

C.J..
No.

STEVE
A new program?

C.J.
They're just polishing the language.

STEVE
Well, C.J., if there's a policy shift or a new program, it'd help to have
the old text
to compare it with...

C.J.
There isn't a policy shift, there isn't a new program, this is Sam being Sam.

Charlie enters and gets C.J.'s attention.

REPORTER
Has political pressure from the NEA forced changes in the...

C.J.
Nothing's forced changes in the speech, there are no policy shifts and no new
initiatives, I guarantee you. Carol?

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J.
[leaving with Charlie] Excuse me.

CAROL
Guys, they're in your press packets, if you could just hand them forward...

CHARLIE
He wanted me to tell you that we're approaching South Bend and that he likes
to hear
the song at a brisk and steady tempo.

C.J.
[staring at Charlie] Oh, kill me now!

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Margaret enters. Leo is reading.

MARGARET
Leo.

LEO
[motions her to wait a second] Yeah?

MARGARET
Colonel Chase.

LEO
[as Mark enters] Mark, tell me we didn't hit anything.

MARK
No, F-18s fired over the bow and the tanker stopped.

LEO
We boarded?

MARK
Yeah, but the crew threw the log and the registry overboard.

LEO
Mark!

MARK
Also the ship's manifest.

LEO
How do these people think this is going to end? What is their best-case
scenario?

MARK
I just go where you point me. I'm going to have to brief Fitzwallace now.

LEO
Yeah, thanks, Mark.

Mark exits.

LEO
Margaret!

MARGARET
[entering] Yeah?

LEO
Can you get me Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill?

MARGARET
Yeah.

LEO
And I need Air Force One the next free minute he's got, okay?

MARGARET
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT
The President is with two advisors, Steve Adamley and Mike.

STEVE
That's usually pretty hard to get through Congress.

BARTLET
Why?

STEVE
Subway money.

BARTLET
It's a northeastern thing?

STEVE
Once you get south of DC or west of Chicago, there aren't any subways,
and the ones
they've got, nobody's using.

BARTLET
What about Miami and San Francisco?

Someone knocks.

BARTLET
Come in!

STEVE
L.A., Miami, San Francisco, maybe someday, but nobody's using them now.

C.J. enters. Mike stares at her hat. She stares back. He smiles just a
little.

BARTLET
So pavement's going to win this battle?

ADVISOR [VO]
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay, thanks, Steve.

They all rise as the advisors exit.

STEVE
Thank you, Mr. President.

MIKE
Thank you.

BARTLET
Thank you, Mike.

STEVE
[to C.J.] Nice hat.

C.J.
Thank you.

BARTLET
[putting on jacket] Ernesto Perez Balladares, former President of Panama. You
know where
he went to school? Notre Dame.

C.J.
Yes, sir, also Joe Garagiola.

BARTLET
Was that a crack?

C.J.
No, sir. I understand you'd like to hear the song now?

BARTLET
[as he and C.J. walk out] Yeah, but we gotta do it later. The Tokyo Exchange
just opened
and I'm gonna gauge the impact on Pacific Rim Banking Reforms. A subject
economics
scholars could take years on, I will take 20 minutes.

C.J.
Speaking of which, Mr. President, I was asked about the late departure
tonight.

BARTLET
I thought we left on time.

C.J.
The late scheduled departure.

BARTLET
You don't like late flights?

C.J.
No, I was just repeating-

Bartlet and C.J. enter another cabin. Sam and Toby are seated.

BARTLET
A long flight across the night? You know why late flights are good? Because
we cease to
be earthbound and burdened with practicality. Ask the impertinent
question. Talk about
the idea nobody has thought about yet. [pointing to Sam] Put it a different
way.

SAM
Be poets.

BARTLET
If you absolutely must.

SAM
Tell Toby.

TOBY
Sam...

SAM
He doesn't want to use the phrase "permanent revolution."

BARTLET
In education?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Mao took a lot of long plane flights, Toby. Look out your window. Is there
anything more
romantic than that? [pointing out cabin window]

C.J.
And that's why we left at 905?

BARTLET
No, we left at 905 because they thought my budget meeting might run over. But
wouldn't
that have been great if that was the reason?

SAM
[looking up] Yes.

BARTLET
[to Toby] You don't like "permanent revolution"?

A phone rings in background.

TOBY
It's a nifty phrase, but I think if we call for a permanent revolution,
people
are, you know, gonna expect one.

CHARLIE
[holding phone] Mr. President?

BARTLET
We're flying, Toby. Live a little. [standing and walking to Charlie] Yeah?

CHARLIE
Mr. McGarry.

BARTLET
Oh, Leo, just take the damn boat...

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. AINSLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Ainsley is sitting at her desk with a fan blowing. Someone knocks on the door.

DONNA
Hello?

AINSLEY
Is that C.J.?

DONNA
[opening door] No, it's Donna Moss.

AINSLEY
Hi.

DONNA
[looks around the office] What happened?

AINSLEY
I cant't turn the heat down.

DONNA
Did you try?

AINSLEY
No. I just looked at the thermostat and got frustrated.

DONNA
[in disbelief] Really.

AINSLEY
Of course, I tried! I could grow papayas in here.

DONNA
It's a nice office.

AINSLEY
It's the steam pipe distribution venue.

DONNA
It's got character.

AINSLEY
I think I'm losing weight.

DONNA
Wanna come work upstairs in the bullpen?

AINSLEY
I need to concentrate.

DONNA
Nobody's here.

AINSLEY
No, I'm fine.

DONNA
Okay. I just came down to say hi.

AINSLEY
And I'd talk but I just... I need to get this done.

DONNA
I'll leave you alone.

AINSLEY
Thanks.

DONNA
What are you working on?

AINSLEY
I'm making notes for Josh.

DONNA
Ah. [sits down]

AINSLEY
Yeah.

DONNA
Interesting.

AINSLEY
Yeah.

DONNA
The Constitutional questions involved.

AINSLEY
Yeah.

DONNA
Full faith and credit.

AINSLEY
[looks up from her computer] Right.

DONNA
[pauses] Do you and I look alike?

AINSLEY
I'm sorry?

DONNA
Do we look alike?

AINSLEY
No.

DONNA
That's what I thought. I didn't think we looked alike.

AINSLEY
Yeah.

DONNA
Have you ever thought about dying your hair red?

AINSLEY
No.

DONNA
You should.

AINSLEY
Why?

DONNA
It'd look good.

AINSLEY
We don't look alike.

DONNA
No, and I tell people that. [pause] I'm going to work upstairs. [stands]

AINSLEY
I'll see you tomorrow.

DONNA
I think it's because of the alabaster skin and the farm girl looks that...

AINSLEY
You're wigging out, Donna.

DONNA
Yes. Are you sure you don't want to work upstairs?

AINSLEY
No. It may be hot down here but at least it's quiet.

The pipes make a loud banging sound, startling Ainsley.

AINSLEY
Okay.

She shuts her computer notebook and stands.

AINSLEY
Boy, I could use a Fresca.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh and Skinner are talking.

JOSH
You're going to quote the bible to me?

SKINNER
I didn't...

JOSH
Really?

SKINNER
My point was hat the founders based the country on Judeo-Christian
morality...

JOSH
[pacing] Matt...

SKINNER
...and that the biblical concept of marriage maybe can't be separated from
the law quite
as easily as you'd like.

JOSH
The founding fathers made it very clear that they didn't want Judeo-Christian
morality
within 10 city blocks of the law. Matt! [pause]

SKINNER
What?

Josh pauses, looking at Skinner.

SKINNER
What?

JOSH
Nothing. [sits] You understand that gay partners will be permanently ineligable
for
survivor benefits, Medicare, Medicaid....

SKINNER
Which the government can't afford to pay anyway.

JOSH
So we caught a break there. [sighs]

SKINNER
It's getting pretty late.

JOSH
I had more notes.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
C.J. is walking down the hallway.

C.J.
Carol?

CAROL
Yeah?

C.J.
Did you get the old drafts back?

CAROL
Of the education speech?

C.J.
Yeah.

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J. nods and turns to walk back down the hall.

CAROL
Except Danny's.

C.J.
[turns back toward Carol] Excuse me?

CAROL
Danny wanted to keep his.

C.J.
Excuse me.

She storms past Carol into the reporters' area and stands in front of Danny.

C.J.
What's the problem?

DANNY
[looks up at her from his seat] How ya doing?

C.J.
What's the problem, Danny?

DANNY
C.J., there's no earthly reason why I should give you that draft back and
you know it.
You can't even believe you're asking me for it. So unless you're going to
give me a hot
towel and some chocolate chip cookies, you better...

C.J.
Everybody else gave it back, Danny.

DANNY
Then everybody else can read my paper tomorrow.

C.J.
[looks up and addresses all the reporters] I'm guaranteeing you all no
substantive
changes, no new policy initiatives.

DANNY
You don't have to guarantee me anything. I've got the old draft right here.

C.J.
[leans over and stage whispers to Danny] I certainly hope we don't accidentally
send
your luggage to Belgium on the way back. [walks away]

DANNY
[raising his voice] Yeah, I wouldn't want to find out what it's like to be
inconvenianced
by the White House!

C.J. stops at the doorway and turns to speak to a reporter in the front.

C.J.
It was the budget meeting, by the way.

STEVE
What's that?

C.J.
The reason we took off late. It was the budget meeting. Although there's
something to be
said for... [pause] something to be said for...

REPORTER
Something to be said for what?

C.J.
Nothing.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
In the staff cabin, Toby, Bartlet, and Sam are working on the education
speech.
Charlie is sitting in a chair writing.

TOBY
[reading from speech] "I was raised to appreciate the value of teachers and
teaching.
My grandmother, who began her teaching career in a one-room schoolhouse..."

BARTLET
Actually, it was two rooms.

TOBY
Okay.

BARTLET
Italian stonecutters were paying her to teach their kids English in the
basement of the
rectory. They put up a wall and made it two rooms as a thank you gift.

TOBY
We'll change it to two rooms.

BARTLET
I haven't heard the big idea yet.

TOBY
Sir, the speech is in pretty good shape.

BARTLET
Yeah. [reads from speech] "As you know, I began my campaign...'' [looks at
Toby] What
happened to 100,000 new teachers?

TOBY
Sir?

BARTLET
No money?

TOBY
No teachers.

BARTLET
Toby!

TOBY
There aren't a 100,000 new teachers. We can't make people be teachers.

BARTLET
We can give incentives.

TOBY
In certain public districts there are tax incentives...

BARTLET
Well, it's not doing the trick.

TOBY
No. No. I know. But for right now...

SAM
[looking at what Charlie is writing] What's that mean?

CHARLIE
I'm sorry?

SAM
What does that mean?

CHARLIE
I was just scribbling.

SAM
You wrote down, "Send them to college."

CHARLIE
[sounding scared] I was just scribbling.

SAM
What did you mean when you wrote down, "send them to college"?

CHARLIE
No, 'cause it's like circling horses in the paper but not making the bet.

BARTLET
[stands and walks toward Charlie] Tuition incentives.

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Talk, Charlie.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, if this was an idea, somebody would have had it already.

BARTLET
I find fault with that formula.

CHARLIE
Well...

BARTLET
What?

CHARLIE
The government will send you to college or law school or medical school if
you spend
three years in the armed forces. Why not...

SAM
[pacing] College tuition to anyone who wants to go college in exchange for
they teach
in a public school where we send'em for three years.

BARTLET
Why can't that idea be floated?

TOBY
Anybody know how we pay for it?

BARTLET
That comes later.

TOBY
Yes, it does come next, so for the moment why don't we...

BARTLET
Kick this around.

TOBY
Mr. President...

BARTLET
[walks to the door] I'll be in my study. It's an incredible sky tonight.

PILOT [via P.A.]
Ladies and gentleman, this is Colonel Beach from the flight deck. We've been
told there's
choppy wind ahead and we've been cleared to climb to 42,000 feet.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

SKINNER [VO]
57% of the people...

JOSH [VO]
I know what 57% of the people say.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Josh and Skinner are walking down the hallway.

JOSH
58% of the people say that gay spouses should receive health benefits and 54%
say Social
Security benefits and by the way we haven't talked about the 14th amendment.

SKINNER
Uh, Josh, the 14th amend...

JOSH
I think a strict interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause would dictate
that
homophobia can't be made into a law.

SKINNER
That's for the court to decide; but I think they'll uphold it.

They enter JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh stands behind his desk facing Skinner.

JOSH
Lawrence Tribe disagrees with you.

SKINNER
Lawrence Tribe doesn't sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.

JOSH
Five Justices!

SKINNER
Josh, I came here as a friend. I think you know that.

JOSH
What does that have to do with it?

SKINNER
I came here 'cause I came here. Look. This is gonna be a law whether the
President
vetoes it or not. They have the votes in the Senate to override it.

JOSH
The Senate's not in session. The President could stick this in his pants
pocket and
it's vetoed.

SKINNER
And it will come back in January and you will have to live through this
twice. And you
will lose both times.

JOSH
Matt!

SKINNER
Ask me the question.

JOSH
He compared homosexuality to kleptomania and sex addition, Matt.

SKINNER
Yes.

JOSH
The Majority Leader. The leader of your own party.

SKINNER
He was wrong and I told him so.

JOSH
For cryin' out loud!

SKINNER
Ask me the question, Josh!

JOSH
How can you be a member of this party?!?

SKINNER
You've been holding that in for way too long, man.

JOSH
This party who says that who you are is against the law.

SKINNER
You know, I never understand why you gun control people don't all join the
N.R.A. They've
got two million members. You bring three million to the next meeting... call
a vote...
All those in favor of tossing guns - [Snaps fingers] - Bam! Move on.

JOSH
That's a heck of a strategy, Matt. I'll bring that up in a meeting.

Josh sighs heavily as he collapses into his chair.

SKINNER
I agree with 95% of the Republican platform. I believe in local government. I'm
in favor
of individual rights rather than group rights. I believe free markets lead
to free people
and that the country needs a strong national defense. My life doesn't have
to be about
being a homosexual. It doesn't have to be entirely about that.

Josh looks at Skinner thoughtfully before deciding not to continue.

JOSH
Thanks for coming by.

SKINNER
Thanks for the beer. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Two men are waiting on Skinner. One sits while the other paces. Skinner
walks up.

MAN 1
Oh... there he is. [to Skinner] How'd it go?

SKINNER
He'll sign it.

Josh observes the congressmen from his doorway.

MAN 1
Ooo hoo! I can tell McDougal?

SKINNER
[puts on his coat] Yeah.

As they head for the exit, one of them claps Skinner's shoulder. His hand
lingers there.

MAN 1
Good job, Congressman!

SKINNER
Take your hand off my shoulder, Congressman.

The camera lingers on a conflicted Josh watching the exiting congressmen.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - NIGHT

	WATERSHED VECTOR - JET ROUTE 60
	CASPER, WYOMING

Toby sits behind a desk and Sam paces in front of the desk.

TOBY
The speech is fine now.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
Speech is fine.

SAM
100,000 college scholarships...

TOBY
It's an overly simplistic...

SAM
Toby...

C.J. opens the office door which cuts Toby and Sam short.

C.J.
You wanted me?

SAM
You should tip the press off we might float an education initiative.

C.J.
[confused] But, I just told them...

TOBY
We're not floating.

SAM
We might float, I'm sayin' and you should give them a heads up.

C.J.
Excuse me. I need to go look like an idiot.

C.J. leaves closing the office door behind her.

TOBY
We're not floating a policy initiative, Sam. I don't care if it's a trip to
the moon on
gossamer wings.

SAM
Look...

TOBY
It's pie in the sky to say nothing of patronizing to have privileged Ivy
Leaguers play
teacher to America's most vulnerable children.

SAM
The people taking advantage of this aren't going to be over-privileged.

TOBY
How do you suppose the teacher's union will feel about it?

SAM
They'll have 100,000 new members.

TOBY
All of whom will leave after three years.

SAM
Most of whom...

TOBY
And the kids will be abandoned as well.

SAM
They won't be abandoned.

TOBY
Their teachers will leave!

SAM
Once you're in fifth grade what do you care what your fourth grade teacher
is doing?

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
Toby, these people are gonna be role models, to kids that don't have much
contact with
young, successful, college graduates many of whom will have grown up in
neighborhoods
just like theirs.

TOBY
Sam.

SAM
Toby, we could have...

TOBY
Sam! Where are we getting the money? [pauses to reign in his temper]
Where are we getting the money?

SAM
I was really mortified that I froze up on that speech.

TOBY
Yeah. [pause] You should've told me a few days ago.

SAM
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Ainsley sits at a desk typing and Donna sits on the desk talking.

DONNA
I played the flute. I'm a flutist. In high school I was the best in my
row. And, so I
ask myself, if I pursued the flute professionally, would I be meeting
interesting men?
And the answer comes back to me. Probably not.

AINSLEY
I played the trombone.

DONNA
Did you meet interesting men?

AINSLEY
Yeah.

DONNA
Is, is it a hard instrument to learn? If I took it up now...

Josh walks up and interrupts Donna who hops up off the desk and exits.

JOSH
Talk to me about the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

AINSLEY
It says that full faith and credit shall be given by each state to the public
acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of every other state - it means if you're
married
in Maryland it's got to be recognized by Nebraska.

JOSH
So, how is the Marriage Recognition Act not unconstitutional?

AINSLEY
'Cause it also says that Congress can proscribe the manner in which such
acts and records
are proved - which means they can decide what being married means within
the context of
Article IV.

Donna is behind the glass partition in the bullpen and has answered a phone.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
[pointing to phone sitting in cradle] Toby.

Josh walks around the glass partition and picks up the phone.

JOSH
Yeah?

TOBY
What's goin' on?

JOSH
I'm going to tell him to sign the damn thing.

TOBY
Okay.

JOSH
How's his mood?

TOBY
He's frustrated. He's feeling...

JOSH
You know when he goes off on a thing Toby, he expects you to bring him in. He
wants you
to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, STAFF CABIN - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
Josh, off the top of your head, what do you think about tuition incentives
for...

Toby stops mid-question as he hears an announcement on the PA begin.

PILOT [via P.A.]
Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight deck. We're 82 miles south of the
runway and
beginning our descent. We'd like to ask you all to find a seat. Thank you.

JOSH
What was that?

TOBY
We're landing.

JOSH
No, I mean, what were you going to...

TOBY
Nothing.

JOSH
All right. I'll talk to you later.

Josh and Donna begin making their way out of the bullpen past Ainsley. Josh
walks a pace
in front of Donna.

JOSH
I'm gonna talk to Leo.

AINSLEY
I'll see you guys Monday.

DONNA
Good night.

JOSH
Take it easy.

Josh and Donna continue walking down the HALLWAY.

DONNA
Did you know she plays the trombone?

JOSH
I didn't.

DONNA
Tonight stunk, Josh.

JOSH
I'm sorry about that.

DONNA
I didn't mean having to work, although that was a treat. I meant the guy.

JOSH
Who was he?

DONNA
A lobbyist with Travis West. He was pretty full of himself and without a
lot of cause
to be.

JOSH
An obnoxious insurance lobbyist? What were the odds?

DONNA
That isn't funny, Josh.

JOSH
I gotta go see Leo.

Josh turns and continues walking down the hallway as Donna veers off to
start heading
for the exit.

DONNA
I'll call you in the morning.

Josh stops walking and turns back towards Donna.

JOSH
You look really great in that dress tonight, Donna. You should buy it for
yourself.

Josh smiles at Donna and again turns to walk towards Leo's office. Donna
smiles as she
watches Josh walk away before exiting herself.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo sits on his couch with a phone sitting next to him.

BARTLET
[on speakerphone] Yeah?

Leo doesn't answer immediately. Bartlet repeats himself less patiently.

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
We hold the ship in Bahrain.

BARTLET
It doesn't do anything to hold the ship in Bahrain

LEO
Sir, we hold the ship in Bahrain and then send a sample of the oil to the
U.S. customs
lab in San Francisco. If the point of origin violates sanctions...

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT

	BONNEVILLE-3 LANDING ROUTE
	PORTLAND, OREGON

Bartlet is standing talking on the phone.

BARTLET
Yeah. You know what's going to happen? They'll sell off the cargo in a
friendly port.
780,000 metric tons of gas oil against a two million dollar fine for the
oil company.

LEO
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Which their profits from the sale will more than cover. We're not providing
much of a
disincentive to evade U.N. sanctions.

Josh enters LEO'S OFFICE and takes a seat in the chair near Leo.

LEO
What else is there to do?

BARTLET
If we're going to have sanctions at all, I think we should make them stick. I
think
that we should confiscate the cargo, seize the ship, sell the oil and use
the money
to beef up anti-smuggling operations.

LEO
You don't mean tonight. You mean in the future...

Bartlet sighs heavily in resignation. C.J. enters the room.

C.J.
We're landing, Mr. President.

BARTLET
[to Leo] Yeah. In the future.

LEO
Okay. Josh wants to talk about the...

BARTLET
[to Leo] Hang on. [to C.J.] You need me?

C.J.
I can wait.

BARTLET
[into phone] Yeah.

JOSH
The Marriage Recognition Act.

BARTLET
[sighs] Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, PRESS AREA - NIGHT
C.J. approaches the front of the Press Area facing the reporters. As
C.J. begins to
speak, Toby approaches and stands near C.J..

C.J.
Folks, we'll be landing in just a few minutes. Follow the blue signs to your
bus.
Oh, one thing before we land, when I said before that there'd be absolutely
no policy
shifts or new initiatives in the education speech tomorrow... That was correct,
except
it's possible there might be a policy shift or new initiative in the education
speech
tomorrow.

The reporters groan and grumble.

TOBY
There isn't going to be a change.

REPORTER
Toby!

TOBY
There isn't going to be a change! [to C.J.] Danny?

C.J.
He's not going to give it back.

Toby heaves a sigh and walk over to Danny then sits in the seat beside him.

TOBY
Danny, Sam choked hard on the last draft and wants to burn it.

Danny pauses a couple of seconds to think it over.

DANNY
No problem.

C.J.
[incredulous] No problem?

DANNY
[to Toby] Tell him to relax. He'll get his swing back.

TOBY
Yeah.

Toby stands and begins to walk away.

DANNY
Tell him I didn't read it.

TOBY
[smiling slightly] Thanks.

Toby exits with the draft in hand.

C.J.
You were just having a little go at me, weren't you?

DANNY
Yeah. It's a long flight.

C.J.
So you decided to kill time by...

DANNY
Yeah. You know why?

C.J.
Tell me you went to Notre Dame.

DANNY
Maybe next time you won't be so quick to mock on the eve of a Michigan game.

C.J. frowns at Danny a moment before turning and walking towards the front
of the plane
away from the Press Area.

C.J.
[to herself] There must be an escape hatch here of some kind.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Josh continues his conversation with Bartlet. Leo paces the office listening.

JOSH
The constitutional argument...

BARTLET
I don't care about the constitutional argument. It's gay bashing. It's
legislative gay
bashing. How do I put my name on it?

JOSH
I wouldn't, sir. I'd put it away.

BARTLET
Pocket veto's a politician's way out.

JOSH
They'll send the bill again when they're in session. Meanwhile, we focus on
the
Employment Non-discrimination Act.

BARTLET
If I'm going to sign it in January, why am I vetoing it now?

JOSH
As a symbolic gesture to the gay community.

BARTLET
I'm sure the gay community can't wait to thank me.

LEO
Mr. President.

BARTLET
This is just wrong.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
[getting worked up] You can look at the policy numbers and Article IV and
Social Security
benefits. It doesn't matter. It's just wrong. We shouldn't be defining love
and we
certainly shouldn't be ill-defining it. It's wrong. This is the job for... This
is the
job of somebody else.

LEO
Well, right now it's ours.

BARTLET
It's wrong.

LEO
Sir.

BARTLET
I should get out a rubber stamp that says 'Josiah Bartlet votes no.'

JOSH
That's just what the conservatives are hoping you'll do.

BARTLET
I should get out a rubber stamp!

Bartlet heaves an exasperated sigh.

LEO
Sir.

BARTLET
Put it in a drawer.

LEO
Yes, sir.

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President.

LEO
We'll talk at the hotel. [hangs up]

Leo and Josh sit quietly a second.

JOSH
Okay.

LEO
All right.

JOSH
Have a good night.

LEO
You too.

JOSH
Hey Leo, Margaret mentioned...

LEO
Oh, come on Josh!

JOSH
No, she just said...

LEO
My divorce papers came today. She thinks I'm going to drink.

JOSH
It seems like a pretty good reason to.

LEO
I'm an alcoholic, I don't need a good reason to.

JOSH
You wanna have coffee someplace?

LEO
I wanna go home.

JOSH
Okay.

LEO
I'll see you on Monday.

Josh exits. Leo grabs his coat and scarf and starts putting them on.

LEO
[calls] Margaret, I'm going.

Margaret stops what she's doing and walks into Leo's office.

MARGARET
[with a resigned tone, yet worried expression] Okay.

Leo looks at Margaret for a moment.

LEO
[quietly] You're a good girl.

Leo turns and leaves, closing his office door behind him as Margaret watches.

MARGARET
[pacified] Okay.

Margaret closes the door between her office and Leo's as she steps back into
her
own office are

CUT TO: INT. AIR FORCE ONE, THE PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT
Bartlet is sitting in a chair reading something as C.J. enters.

C.J.
Sir?

BARTLET
Yeah?

C.J.
You're off the phone?

BARTLET
Yeah.

C.J. crosses room and sits on bench next to Bartlet.

BARTLET
There was a question?

C.J.
For a sidebar, on the game tomorrow.

She indicates the hat to show she means the Notre Dame game.

C.J.
Why did you go to Notre Dame?

BARTLET
Why not?

C.J.
Bearing in mind that I'm just repeating someone else's question. You were
accepted at
Harvard, Yale, and Williams. Why did you go to Notre Dame?

BARTLET
Because I was thinking about becoming a priest.

C.J.
Really?

BARTLET
Yeah.

C.J.
What happened?

BARTLET
I met Abbey.

C.J.
[obviously touched] Why don't you ever give me answers like that when we're
running
for something?

BARTLET
Because I like to bother you.

C.J.
Well, I shall not be defeated.

BARTLET
Sit down.

C.J.
Okay. [sits]

Toby enters the office carrying a folder. He extracts some pages and hands
them to
Bartlet.

TOBY
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Toby.

TOBY
Here's the final draft.

BARTLET
Toby, you should sit down. We're landing in one minute and ten seconds.

TOBY
How do you know that?

BARTLET
I set my watch to the cockpit computer. You should sit down.

TOBY
Thank you.

BARTLET
Do you know why the Assistant Energy Secretary is on the plane?

TOBY
You have a meeting with him on the way back.

BARTLET
That's right.

TOBY
I think Charlie's idea was a good one. I think you should ask Leo to put
together a team
to study the feasibility of appropriations for a pilot program with 100
teachers.

BARTLET
They're taking the tanker to Bahrain and then the company's going to make
a profit.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
The Marriage Recognition Act is going to be law.

In the background we hear the landing gear go down...

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
100 new teachers?

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Instead of 100,000.

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Well, it's a start I guess.

We hear the screech of the airplane's wheels touching down.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
