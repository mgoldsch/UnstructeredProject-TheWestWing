TEASER

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Margaret knocks and enters. Two men are seated, talking to Leo.

BILL
Most of us are just hearing the news now.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
From a conference call.

LEO
Yes.

BILL
There hasn't been a lot of time to digest this.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
...But what we do know is that it's the House Democrats that are going to
take it in the
throat.

LEO
Yeah.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
You might be able to get the voters to accept MS in some suburban districts,
but the
whole House is up for reelection.

LEO
Yeah.

BILL
It's not a matter of accepting M... There was a cover...

CONGRESSMAN WADE
The point is, even if you could squeeze out an electoral...

BILL
Even if you can squeeze out a win, this is what the campaign is going to be
about.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
You're going to have Democrats telling the President, "Don't come to my
district; I've
got troubles enough," and your campaign never gets out of the Rose Garden.

BILL
Yes, and we're running without a standard bearer. At a time when we've got
policy cases
against the Republicans on tax cuts, environment, education... and *this*
is what the
campaign's going to be about.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
Now, Leo, most of us are just hearing the news. And I don't like to be the
first one to
say it, but I'm gonna. I think the President has got to strongly consider
not running
for reelection.

LEO
[beat] You think you're the first one to say it?

CONGRESSMAN WADE
Leo...

LEO
You are, at minimum, the 35th in the last two hours.

CONGRESSMAN WADE
Well, we're the ones that are talking to you now. And we're the ones that
are asking.
Is the President going to run for reelection?

LEO
Harry, Bill, there's going to be a press conference tonight. I'd watch.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Toby is speaking to a couple of guys about the room they're in.

TOBY
He'll sit here, with the First Lady on his right.

LARRY
You don't want him in front of the fireplace?

TOBY
The fireplace is too much. He'll sit here, which means they're gonna have
to light the
room from the outside the window. Do they know that?

LARRY
We'll let them know.

TOBY
The last time they didn't know. The President taped an Easter message that
looked like
it was lit by Ed Wood!

Toby exits to the HALLWAY. Sam walks up.

SAM
Toby.

TOBY
A pitcher of water, but keep it off-screen.

SAM
Do they know?

TOBY
They gotta light from outside the window, if they don't light from outside
the window...

SAM
I don't care. Look, Toby, has anyone considered whether or not he's up for
this?

TOBY
Up for this?

SAM
I mean, some stuff has happened since...

TOBY
C.J. gave it to the network. We're pretty much locked in, so...

SAM
When are we prepping with him?

TOBY
After the service.

SAM
There's gonna be time?

TOBY
We'll have the afternoon.

SAM
I think we should consider taking...

TOBY
[walking away] There aren't any options left. We're going on TV, at eight.

GINGER
[walking up] Toby...

TOBY
Yeah.

GINGER
I'm sorry, but I had to put Greg Summerhays back on your schedule.

TOBY
No, I took him off.

GINGER
Leo's office had me put him back on.

TOBY
Why?

GINGER
They wanted you to keep the appointment.

TOBY
[stopping] We've got her funeral today. We've got these...

GINGER
I said four o'clock.

TOBY
[pats Ginger's arm then walks] Yeah, all right.

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'s OFFICE - DAY
C.J. enters and walks to Carol's desk.

C.J.
Carol.

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J.
[handing her a folder] AP, Reuters, Agence France, something about seating on
Air Force One...

CAROL
Seating arrangements?

C.J.
[nodding] Seating arrangements on Air Force One.

C.J. walks into her office, and Josh enters.

JOSH
C.J.?

C.J.
Listen, I was thinking since it's probably going to be a light day, I'd
maybe blow off
work, go shopping or something. What do you need?

JOSH
Can I give you a quick brief?

C.J.
Sure.

JOSH
The Justice Department's run out of money in their suit against the tobacco
companies.

C.J.
The Justice Department's overmatched.

JOSH
Yeah, by hundreds of millions of dollars. They're asking for $30 million
and we think
they should have it.

C.J.
Who disagrees with us?

JOSH
Eight of the fifteen members of the subcommittee that controls the budgets
for Justice
and Commerce, including Kalmbach, who has significant ties to tobacco,
and Warren and
Rossiter, who do not.

C.J.
We lost two Democrats?

JOSH
They have ideological objections.

C.J.
Yeah, it's just not a good time to be losing Democrats.

JOSH
You haven't been in my office this morning.

C.J.
We'll get them back.

They walk-and-talk down the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Anyway, uh, Leo felt pretty strongly that we ought to light a fire under it,
so I wrote
up a strongly worded release.

C.J.
[skimming] 'The White House, for immediate release, Office of the Press. Today
the
President calls on Congress... deserve their day in court, and this
administration won't
sit on the bench while well-fed members of the Appropriations Committee
choke off funding
for a lawsuit aimed at perpetrators of hundreds of thousands of negligent
homicides while
filling their campaign war chests.' [looks up at Josh in amazement]
This is like the fire we used to throw in the early primaries.

JOSH
[smiling] Let Bartlet be Bartlet.

C.J.
You got to put it away for a while.

JOSH
You think?

C.J.
I'm going in there now to tell them a landing ship helicopter assault team
is steaming
off Port-au-Prince and after that I'm bringing in AP, Reuters, and Agence
France.
Nobody's gonna write about an Appropriations Bill. Haiti's gonna get bumped
to the
Lifestyle section.

JOSH
Yeah, I suppose.

C.J. starts to walk away.

JOSH
Listen... Have you seen him today?

C.J.
[turning back] No. Have you?

JOSH
No.

C.J.
All right. Listen, I've gotta...

JOSH
Yeah. Thanks.

C.J. turns and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Sam is meeting with Democratic Party strategists.

HANSON
Why are we assuming it's Hoynes?

PHILLIPS
Please...

HANSON
No, why are we assuming it's gotta be Hoynes? You don't think Wetland's
gonna get in
on it? Hutchinson? Seth Gillette?

PHILLIPS
Please...

MAN
Gillette's lucky if he carries his immediate family.

ANOTHER MAN
[in a condescending tone] It's Hoynes.

PHILLIPS
It's Hoynes. Sam, you understand this conversation isn't ruling out Bartlet
as a
candidate, it's just a 'what if?' We're party strategists, it's what we're
paid for.

SAM
Yeah.

MAN
Hoynes is the only one that put together the money this fast.

PHILLIPS
He's the most successful fundraiser this party's ever had.

MAN
Though, obviously, it would be easier if Hoynes was running as an incumbent...

SAM
[has heard enough] Okay.

PHILLIPS
Sam...

SAM
[shutting his portfolio] Thanks.

PHILLIPS
No, it was an inappropriate...

SAM
When I say 'okay,' that's it. Close your notebooks. We don't talk like that
here.
I don't give a damn whose nephew you are. Tommy, President Bartlet's not a
candidate.
He's the President.

Sam stands and leaves the men at the table.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

LEO
What are the conditions inside the embassy?

NANCY
It's still got running water but the power's been cut. The emergency
generator's got
about 24 hours.

LEO
Any injuries?

MAN
There aren't any injuries but the Deputy Chief's a diabetic and he's running
out of
insulin.

LEO
The Red Cross can help us out there?

MAN
Yes, sir.

LEO
What's outside?

NANCY
About 1200 troops now with A-15s positioned outside the gates. They've got
four 105mm
Howitzers.

LEO
Which are trained at?

The camera PANS to the profile of Bartlet.

NANCY
Our front door.

Church bells ring softly in the background as Bartlet drowns out Nancy's
voice and
has a FLASHBACK.

NANCY
Mr. President, we want to send Fitz down there.

BARTLET
Why?

NANCY
There's a Haitian general named Francis St. Jacques. He trained with Fitz
at Annapolis...

FADE OUT and FADE IN to a new scene of the FLASHBACK. The bells get louder
and we see
a church on a bright day. A group of boys stands around talking.

DR. BARTLET [OS]
Jed! [beat] Jed!

BOY
Jed, Jed, your father's calling you.

Young Jed Bartlet hears and runs to his father, who is standing with another
man.

DR. BARTLET
Didn't you hear me calling you?

JED
No sir, I didn't. I was, uh, I didn't.

DR. BARTLET
Mr. Spence found this cigarette butt on the floor in the aisle of the chapel.

JED
People shouldn't put their cigarettes out in the chapel, Mr. Spence.

DR. BARTLET
Well, people shouldn't be smoking in the chapel, I think is my point,
Jed. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

JED
Yes, sir.

DR. BARTLET
Could you tell your friends, please?

JED
[turning to leave] Yeah.

DR. BARTLET
Jed, hang on. I want you to meet someone. She's going to be taking over in
my office for
Mrs. Tillinghouse.

He turns and gets attention of a woman who is talking with a group of people.

DR. BARTLET
Excuse me!

A young, pretty blonde turns.

DR. BARTLET
This is Dolores Landingham. Mrs. Landingham, this is my eldest son, Jed.

Jed and Mrs. Landingham look at each other and smile.

LEO [VO]
So what happens?

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - PRESENT
Bartlet listens, tapping an unlit cigarette on the table.

NANCY
Basically we think we can get St. Jacques to fracture Bazan's army.

LEO
So if we invade...?

NANCY
It becomes peacekeeping.

Leo turns to look at Bartlet.

BARTLET
Okay. Send Fitzwallace down. Anything else?

NANCY
No, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.

They all stand. Bartlet exits and walks and talks with Charlie. They go up
the STAIRS.

BARTLET
They've been in there 48 hours.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
The guy's been President of his country for two days. He's spent them both
at gunpoint.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

BARTLET
What do you know about this storm?

CHARLIE
The one...?

BARTLET
It's moving from Florida to South Carolina.

CHARLIE
Yeah. It's supposed to be bad.

BARTLET
It's a tropical storm.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
No I mean it's been designated a tropical storm. That means it has a surface
wind
speed of something.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Isn't it strange to have a tropical storm in May?

CHARLIE
I'm not certain.

BARTLET
I'm pretty sure there's a season and this isn't it.

CHARLIE
I could have someone find out for you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I mean it's not a big deal. It's just that I'm pretty sure it's strange.

CHARLIE
The Motorcade will leave for the cathedral in an hour.

BARTLET
You ever been to National Cathedral?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You know you could lay the Washington Monument down on its side in that
church?

CHARLIE
I did, actually.

They enter the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
We should try it.

CHARLIE
You only have two meetings between now and then. Is there anything else you
need, sir?

BARTLET
[entering the Oval Office] I need pallbearers.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

As Bartlet passes, the camera focuses in on Mrs. Landingham's desk, which
has been left
untouched.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE TO: INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY
C.J.'s image appears on a television screen at the back of the room. The
room is filled
with reporters. C.J. is standing behind the podium with Carol on her right.

C.J.
Also in the combat radius will be six J-Socs out of McDill and a Battalion
Landing Team.
They'll cover that at the Pentagon briefing.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

C.J.
Yes.

WOMAN REPORTER
Does the fact that the OAS has passed a resolution allowing you to explore
military
options mean you've exhausted the diplomatic ones?

C.J.
Of course it doesn't, but it should underline the consequences for Bazan
should he decide
to enter our embassy and/or arrest the democratically elected President of
Haiti. That's
all I have for now. Thank you.

C.J. turns and leaves.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

Carol raises her hand to quiet the crowd and steps to the podium.

CAROL
Before you all go, C.J. needs to see AP, Reuters, and Agence France in the
office. She
needs to discuss seating arrangements on Air Force One.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. strides through the hall. Sam spots her and walks after her. They
pedeconference
as they talk.

SAM
C.J.

C.J.
Yeah.

SAM
We've got a problem.

C.J.
[sighs] That's pretty hard to believe.

SAM
We can't have the press conference in the East Room.

C.J.
What are you talking about?

SAM
I just got off the phone with Brian Coburn and we can't have it in the East
Room.

C.J.
[alarmed] Why not?

SAM
They've been pulling the wiring and they found asbestos and they have to
seal it off.

C.J.
[throws her hand up in the air, exasperated] There's been asbestos in the
East Room
this whole time?

SAM
Yeah. So I'm gonna make a list...

They reach a set of French doors leading to the JOSH'S BULLPEN
AREA. C.J. proceeds
through the doors, but Sam stays behind in the hall.

C.J.
[turns to look at Sam] Put together - okay - put together a list of
alternatives.

SAM
Yeah.

C.J. walks briskly to her office. Carol, Steve, and the other two reporters,
one of whom
is a woman, are standing in the doorway to C.J.'S OFFICE, waiting for
her. C.J. walks
into her office and the reporters follow her.

C.J.
[to reporters] Come on in...

STEVE
C.J., I don't have any problem with my seat on the plane.

C.J.
[tersely] Get inside.

STEVE
Seriously, I complained that one time cause, I don't know, I was in a bad
mood.

C.J. sets her briefing binder down on her desk.

C.J.
This isn't about seating arrangements. Notebooks, no tape recorders. This
story's
embargoed for an hour, and you'll identify me as a senior White House
official.

C.J. closes the door.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Leo is leaning on the desk, while two advisors give him a briefing. Bartlet
is standing
off to one side, reading, only half listening.

LEO
Are we talking about the opening bell?

ADVISOR 1
That depends... uh... when's it gonna leak?

LEO
I'm sorry?

ADVISOR 1
When are we leaking the story?

LEO
C.J.'s leaking it right now.

Bartlet removes his glasses and turns to listen. Leo checks his watch.

ADVISOR 1
Wall Street'll have it in an hour. In two hours, sellers will outnumber
buyers.

One of the doors to the portico flies open. Bartlet and Leo both turn,
slightly startled.
An agent walks over to close the door.

BARTLET
Excuse me. Keep going.

Bartlet opens the door to the OUTER OFFICE. Charlie is standing near his desk.

LEO
In what sectors?

ADVISOR 2
In all sectors of the New York Stock Exchange...

BARTLET
Charlie.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Do you have any idea why the door to the portico keeps swinging open? It's
a little
annoying.

CHARLIE
They're replacing the latch. It's swinging open from the wind.

BARTLET
[gesturing] But the door opens out.

CHARLIE
When the right sequence of doors are open in the building, there's a wind
tunnel into
the Oval Office.

BARTLET
[small smile] No kidding!

Charlie smiles at Bartlet, who walks back into the office, closing the door
behind
himself.

LEO
What about Europe and Japan?

ADVISOR 1
Well, Japan's gonna be up and trading by the time we go on TV.

BARTLET
Charlie says there's a wind tunnel created by something. They're fixing the
latch.

Bartlet glances over toward the portico as he walks toward Leo and the
advisors.
Margaret steps into the Oval Office via the door to Leo's office.

MARGARET
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
[to Margaret] Is the motorcade ready?

MARGARET
Yes, sir.

Everyone looks at Bartlet, who puts his glasses in his shirt pocket and sighs.

BARTLET
Okay. Well, we've got to go. I don't know what to say. Leo's pretty rich. Maybe
he can
buy some tech stocks and jack up the price.

Leo walks toward the door to his office, where Margaret is waiting.

LEO
[to advisors] Keep me posted on the bellwethers, okay?

ADVISOR 1
Yeah.

ADVISOR 2
Thank you, Mr. President.

The advisors leave. Bartlet appears distracted and melancholy as he buttons
his shirt
cuffs.

LEO
[to Margaret] Is the First Lady meeting us in the car?

MARGARET
Yes. It's a non-denominational service.

Margaret goes back into Leo's office. Leo turns to look at Bartlet. Bartlet
glances over
at Leo.

BARTLET
What did she say?

LEO
She said the First Lady's meeting us in the car.

Bartlet doesn't acknowledge Leo's words. Bartlet turns his back and flips
his suit
jacket on over his head.

CUT TO: INT. SCHOOL OFFICE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960S - DAY
Young Jed Bartlet, with his back turned, flips his suit jacket on over his
head. Young
Mrs. Landingham is in her office, typing. Bartlet pulls a folder from a file
cabinet in
an adjacent office, then walks back into her office.

JED
It wasn't a non-denominational service.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Of course it was.

JED
It wouldn't have felt non-denominational if you were Jewish.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
It was a non-denominational Christian service.

JED
Attendance at chapel's required for every...

Mrs. Landingham stands up and pulls a binder from a cabinet near her desk.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[firmer] It was a non-denominational service.

JED
"Our Father" is not non-denominational.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Everyone says "Our Father."

Jed picks up another file from her desk and they both walk out of her office
into the
hallway. They pedeconference.

JED
Catholics don't. Catholics don't say, "For thine is the Kingdom, the Power
and the Glory,
forever and ever." [shrugs] You know? I'm just saying.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[slightly amused] Why do you work here?

JED
I'm sorry?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Why do you work here after classes? I can't imagine that anyone in your
family's on
work-study.

JED
No, I-I get free tuition, so, you know, I guess it's a good idea to give
something back.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Why do you call your father "sir"?

JED
[chuckles softly] Is this gonna be a whole afternoon of questions?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Well, actually, you've been talking for quite some time.

JED
I'm sorry. Am I boring you, Dolores?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[demurely] "Mrs. Landingham," please!

They stop walking and face each other.

JED
My father's the Headmaster.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[mystified] Yeah, but before he was your Headmaster, he was your father,
right?

JED
I don't wanna make the other guys feel uncomfortable.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
So you call him "sir"?

JED
Yeah.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[still mystified] Oh.

She walks away and Jed watches her go.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON, DC STREET - PRESENT DAY
The repeated peals of sirens and the rumbling of motorcycles fill the air
as the
Presidential motorcade winds through downtown. The Presidential limousine
is also
accompanied by several police cars and black SUVs.

CUT TO: INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Abbey are seated next to each other in the back seat. Bartlet,
looking very
preoccupied and melancholy, stares out the window on his side. Abbey stares
straight
ahead. The silence between them is deafening. After a few moments, Abbey
turns slowly
to look at him.

ABBEY
[gently] You know, they released the girl from the hospital this morning.

Bartlet acknowledges her words, but does not look at her. He barely turns
his eyes from
the window.

BARTLET
The driver?

ABBEY
Yeah...She fractured her wrist, some stitches over her eye, and the other
two had some
scratches and bruises. [clears throat softly] It looks like they're gonna
charge her with
vehicular manslaughter.

Abbey looks over at him, but he doesn't respond. He just stares out the
window. She
looks away, somewhat discouraged, but trying to figure out another way to
reach him.

ABBEY
Frank Mitchell, Joanna... Bill Carney... they told me they were in meetings
all morning.

BARTLET
[absently] Yeah.

Abbey pauses and glances at him tentatively. When she does speak, her manner
and the look
on her face suggest that she doesn't fully agree with the viewpoint that
she describes.

ABBEY
The consensus seems to be that if you step back, and put your support behind
Hoynes,
there's a decent chance the Democrats can keep the White House.

Bartlet keeps staring out the window. After a long pause, he nods slightly.

BARTLET
The world'll rest easier.

Abbey seems a bit stunned by his response. She stares at him, wide eyed,
for several
moments, and then slowly looks away, resigned and sad. She looks almost like
she's
about to cry.

BARTLET
We're here.

CUT TO: EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - DAY
It is a bright, Spring day. The sky is blue and trees are blooming. The
cathedral is
enormous and quite beautiful. As the motorcade pulls up in front of the
church, with
sirens still blaring, the sound of an organ playing a processional fills
the air.

The Presidential limousine stops in front of the steps leading to the main
entrance.
Secret Service agents open the limousine doors for Bartlet and Abbey, who
get out on
opposite sides of the vehicle. Bartlet walks around the back of the limousine
and looks
up at the huge building with a mixture of weariness and sadness. Abbey walks
up the steps
by his side and gently takes his hand. He lets her take it but doesn't react.
They walk inside.

CUT TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS
The high arches of the cathedral are illuminated by a huge, multi-colored
rose window.
Almost all of the attendees are seated as several Secret Service agents and
ushers guide
Abbey and Bartlet to a pew in the front. Abbey sits down and Bartlet sits
down beside
her, exhaling as he sits, as if it takes considerable effort for him to do
so.
REVEREND MONOHAN is seated at the front of the cathedral, facing the
congregants. Once
Bartlet and Abbey are seated, Monohan stands up. He is accompanied to the
pulpit by a
layperson. Toby, C.J., and Charlie look on from their seats.

MONOHAN
"I am the Resurrection and I am Life," says the Lord. "Whoever believes in
Me shall live,
even though he die." God of Mercy, You are the hope of sinners, the joy of
saints.
We pray for our sister Delores whose body we honor with Christian burial.

As Monohan speaks, the camera pans over the faces of Bartlet and Abbey,
then Leo. Sam,
Josh, and Toby are seated together. Margaret, Carol and Donna are seated
together.
Carol is crying. The rose window is illuminated by the daylight.

MONOHAN
Give her happiness with Your saints, and raise up her body with the saints
at the Last
Day to be in Your presence forever...As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,
and that
at the last, He will stand upon the Earth...

The camera lingers on a very somber Bartlet. He is staring straight ahead,
like a statue,
and only half listening to the service, as he drifts back in time.

MONOHAN
After my awaking, He will raise me up...

YOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]
Jed?

MONOHAN
...and in my body, I shall see God...

YOUNG MRS. LANDINGHAM [VO]
Jed!

MONOHAN
...and I myself shall see, and my eyes behold, Him who is my friend...

FADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS, NEW HAMPSHIRE, EARLY 1960s - DAY
It's a sunny afternoon. Young Jed Bartlet is hosing down several sculls. Young
Mrs.
Landingham walks up beside him to catch his attention.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Jed.

Bartlet seems distracted, or perhaps he doesn't hear her. He continues his
work.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Jed!

JED
[looks over, sees her, and smiles slightly] I'm trying to get through an
honest day's
work, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You missed a spot.

JED
I didn't miss it. I just haven't gotten to it yet.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Okay.

JED
You have a habit of doing that, you know?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's that?

JED
Telling me I'm doing something wrong before I've had a chance to do it at all.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[brightly] Well, that must be a little annoying.

JED
Yeah.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I've got a project for you.

JED
Really.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You can show the courage and the intellect and the leadership skills everyone
talks about.

JED
I'm a little busy right now hosing down the boats.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know the women who work at this school are paid less money than the men?

JED
Sorry?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The women are paid less money than the men.

JED
No, I didn't know that.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You think your father does?

FADE TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
Bartlet is still staring straight ahead as the service proceeds. Clearly,
his mind
is elsewhere.

MONOHAN
First reading will be from Mr. Charles Young, from the Book of Wisdom,
Chapter III.

Charlie walks slowly toward the pulpit, led by a layperson.

FADE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - A DIFFERENT DAY, AFTERNOON
The bells of the school chapel are ringing softly. Young Mrs. Landingham is
waiting
for young Bartlet at the end of the school day. She spots him, reading while
he walks,
and gets his attention. They walk across the grounds as they talk.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'd like an opportunity to make my case.

JED
What are you doing here?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I'm raising an issue.

JED
You've been raising this issue for a week now.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I can tell it's had quite an effect on you.

JED
Don't you have a husband?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What does that have to do with anything?

JED
I'm saying, shouldn't you maybe go home when you're done with work?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Shouldn't you be minding your own business?

JED
I just thought, since you're minding everybody else's, you know...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What is that supposed to mean?

JED
In my family, we don't talk about money.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
That's because you have money.

JED
[walking away] Numbers, Mrs. Landingham.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Excuse me?

JED
If you want to convince me of something, show me numbers!

Jed walks away and Mrs. Landingham walks inside a school building, which is
constructed of gray stone.

FADE TO: INT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
The camera drifts across the gray stone walls of the cathedral. Charlie is
standing at
the pulpit, reading.

CHARLIE
"But the souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God. No torment shall
ever touch them."

Bartlet is staring straight ahead. He looks very sad.

CHARLIE
"In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear to die, but they are at peace. For
though
in the sight of others they were punished, their hope is full of immortality."

The camera looks down from high above the congregants. The cathedral is
illuminated by
the soft light filtering through the windows.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
Young Mrs. Landingham approaches Jed's car, which won't start.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Your car won't start.

JED
Yes.

She leans in the window.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's wrong with it?

JED
It's possibly the starter or fan belt.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Do you know anything about cars?

JED
No.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Then how do you know...

JED
Cause that's the two things I've heard of. [gets out]

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You fix your car and pretend you're not listening. I'm just gonna stand here
and talk
cause I know you are.

JED
[lifts the hood] What could you possibly want now?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] I've got numbers.

JED
There's something abnormal about you. [leans under the hood to tinker]

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] Florence Chadwick in the English Department has been here 13
years. She makes
$5,900 a year. Mr. Hopkins in the English Department has been here 4 years
fewer and
makes $7,100.

JED
[walks around her] Is this really the best time for this?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You don't seem to be going anywhere. [follows him, reading] A female cook
makes $3,200
compared to a male electrician who makes $4,100...

DISSOLVE TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - DAY

CONGREGATION
[reading] ....peace. Wherever there is danger, let us sow love. Wherever
there is
injury... harm. And wherever there is doubt, let there be faith in you. Amen.

As music begins, Reverend Monohan leads Toby, Sam, Josh, Charlie and two
other men
towards the casket. Donna, Margaret and Carol look on in tears. Bartlet
looks upset
and deep in thought. The men hoist the casket onto their shoulders. Monohan
leads
the processional out. C.J. bows her head as they pass. Bartlet is still lost
in thought.

DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
Young Jed Bartlet is trying to start his car. Mrs. Landingham is leaning on
the hood
with a steno pad.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] ...gets $2,100. The nurse makes $3,100.

Jed gives up on starting the car and gets out.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[reading] Mrs. Mueller gets paid an additional $200 a year to conduct the
choir and band,
while Mr. Ryan gets paid an additional $400 a year to coach the rowing team.

JED
Crew.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What?

JED
It's not rowing, It's crew. [fiddles under the hood] And Florence Chadwick
is a married
woman with no dependants and Mr. Hopkins has a family of four to support.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
If we paid people by according to how many children they have to support
then Malcolm
Bundy, the groundskeeper, would get triple what the Head Master gets.

JED
Mrs. Landingham...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know I'm right.

JED
Look, what....

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know I'm right. You've known it since I brought it up. You've known it
since before
that.

JED
What do you want me to do about it?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I want you to bring it up with your father.

JED
[looks at her]
See. I'm not a woman and I don't work here.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The women who do are afraid for their jobs. If they bring it up, they're
afraid for their
jobs. What is it you're afraid of?

He looks confused for a moment.

JED
Why do you talk to me like this?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You've never had a big sister and you need one.

They size each other up.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiling] Look at you. You're a Boy King. You're a foot smarter than the
smartest kid in
the class. You're blessed with inspiration. You must know this by now. You
must have
sensed it. Look, if you think we're wrong... if you think Mr. Hopkins should
honestly
get paid more than Mrs. Chadwick, then I respect that. But if you think
we're right and
you won't speak up because you can't be bothered, then God, Jed, I don't
even want to
know you. Come inside. [walks off] I'll call Triple A.

He puts his hands in his pockets and watches her go.

JED
Mrs. Mueller gets half as much to teach music as Mr. Ryan gets to coach crew.

She turns back. Jed smiles and bounces on his heel.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles, victoriously] You're going to do it.

JED
Well, I didn't say that.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, you did.

JED
When?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Just then. You stuck your hands in your pocket. You looked away and smiled.

He nervously takes his hands out of his pockets.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
That means you made up your mind.

JED
That doesn't mean anything.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes it does.

JED
I stuck my hands in my pockets!

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[smiles] And looked away, and smiled. We're in.

She walks away. Jed smiles at her and closes the hood of the car.

CUT TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - PRESENT DAY
Bartlet stands alone glaring at the altar. Most of the guests have left the
church.
Abbey, Leo and Secret Service agents are standing at the back of the
sanctuary.
Leo approaches Bartlet.

LEO
[sighs] It was a beautiful service I thought.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
[quietly] I thought it was a beautiful service. [smiles] She was a real dame,
old friend.
A real broad.

BARTLET
[nodding] Yeah.

LEO
[leans in close] We gotta go back to the office now, sir.

BARTLET
[nods] Yeah.

LEO
[quietly] We've got some decisions to make now.

Bartlet looks absently for a moment.

BARTLET
Leo, would you do me a favor?

LEO
Yeah?

BARTLET
[motions to the agents] Would you ask the agents to seal the cathedral for
a minute?

Leo looks at him.

LEO
Yeah.

Leo walks towards the agents. As Bartlet waits, we hear the wound of several
heavy
doors closing. Bartlet turns back towards the altar.

BARTLET
[tired] You're a son-of-a-bitch, you know that?

He slowly walks up the center aisle.

BARTLET
[tired] She bought her first new car and you hit her with a drunk driver. What,
was
that supposed to be funny? "You can't conceive, nor can I, the appalling
strangeness
of the mercy of God," says Graham Greene. I don't know who's ass he was
kissing there
'cause I think you're just vindictive. What was Josh Lyman? A warning
shot? That was
my son. What did I ever do to yours except praise his glory and praise his
name?
There's a tropical storm that gaining speed and power. They say we haven't
had a storm
this bad since you took out the tender ship of mine last year in the north
Atlantic
last year... 68 crew. Do you know what a tender ship does? Fixes the other
ships.
Doesn't even carry guns. Floats around and fixes the other ships and delivers
that mail.
That's all it can do. [angry] Gratias tibi ago, domine. Yes, I lied. It was
a sin.
[holds out arms] I've committed many sins. Have I displeased you, you feckless
thug?
3.8 million new jobs, that wasn't good? Bailed out Mexico, increased foreign
trade, 30
million new acres for conservation, put Mendoza on the bench, we're not
fighting a war,
I've raised three children...

He ascends the stairs to the Inner Sanctuary.

BARTLET
[pleading] That's not enough to buy me out of the doghouse? Haec credam a
deo pio?
A deo iusto? A deo scito?

He stops at the top of the stairs and extends his arms.

BARTLET
Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci. [angry]

Cruciatus in crucem. [waves dismissively] Eas in crucem!

Bartlet turns away in anger. He descends to the lower sanctuary and lights
a cigarette.
He takes a single puff, drops the butt to the floor, and grinds it defiantly
with his
shoe. He looks back at the altar.

BARTLET
[betrayed] You get Hoynes!

Bartlet holds back tears as he walks down the aisle.

CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
C.J., Sam, Toby and Josh sit. They all look drained and serious.

C.J.
We'll call them Answer A and Answer B.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J.
Mr. President does this mean you won't be seeking a second term. Answer A is
'you bet.
I will absolutely be seeking a second term. Looking forward to the
campaign. There is
great work yet to be done.'

Toby and Sam sit silently.

JOSH
Yes.

C.J.
Answer B...

JOSH
'Are you outta your mind? I can't possibly win the election. I lied about
a degenerative
illness. I'm the target of a Grand Jury investigation and Congress is about
to take me
out to lunch. I'd sooner have my family take off their clothes and dance
the Tarantella
on the Truman Balcony than go through a campaign with this around my neck.'

C.J. drinks water while she thinks.

JOSH
Think that's too on the nose?

C.J.
I do.

SAM
[looks down] I'm gonna bring it up again.

C.J.
Why?

SAM
[angry] Cause I got shouted down the first 3 times and I work here just like
you do.
Can I help you??

C.J. stares at him for a moment.

C.J.
Sorry.

SAM
[starts pacing] I think we have to explore ways of calling this off.

TOBY
Sam...

SAM
I think it might be a mistake to send him on at a moment when we're trying to
demonstrate...

TOBY
Listen...

SAM
[yelling] We don't know what we're talking about in there, Toby. We don't
know if he's
running or not! I think we have to...

TOBY
There's no way. The story's leaked, it's out there. We're doing it. Don't
worry Sam,
it's going to be fine.

He gets up and walks towards his desk.

TOBY
[sarcastic] They're lighting him from outside the window.

Ginger opens the door.

GINGER
Toby...

TOBY
[sighs] I have a meeting with Greg Summerhays for reasons past understanding.

Sam leaves quickly. C.J. and Josh follow him out. GREG SUMMERHAYS enters...

TOBY
Hello.

SUMMERHAYS
Toby....

Summerhays closes the door behind him.

SUMMERHAYS
It's good to see you.

They shake hands.

TOBY
Good Morning, Greg.

SUMMERHAYS
I'm was sorry about the President's secretary.

TOBY
Thank you.

SUMMERHAYS
Do you know her well?

TOBY
Yeah.

Summerhays looks around uncomfortably.

SUMMERHAYS
Let me get to why I'm here. I want to...

TOBY
Buy Atlantic Intermediate.

They sit down.

SUMMERHAYS
[nodding] Yeah.

TOBY
Greg, there's a reason the FCC...

SUMMERHAYS
I'm not here about the FCC.

TOBY
[surprised] Why are you here?

SUMMERHAYS
[leans forward] I'm launching a 24-hour cable news channel and I'm building
it to compete.

Toby looks surprised.

SUMMERHAYS
And I'd like you to be the news director.

Toby tries to bite back his anger.

TOBY
Okay. Thanks for coming in. Excuse me.

Toby storms out.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh aimlessly wanders around his desk, shuffling through files. Donna enters.

DONNA
It was a nice service, don't you think?

Josh looks at her for a moment.

JOSH
Yeah. Yes it was.

DONNA
I'm gonna run across the street to the OEMB for a minute. The President is
still asking
for information on the storm. He's got it caught in his teeth.

Josh shuffles through papers quietly.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Josh, can this really be how it works?

He looks at her.

DONNA
We have no idea if he's gonna run again. He's in a room with Leo making his
decision.
Two people in a matter of minutes. Is this how it works?

The phone rings.

JOSH
[tired] That's how it works today.

Josh wanders over to the credenza and shuffles absently through the
papers. Donna answers
the phone.

DONNA
[into phone] Josh Lyman. [to Josh] It's Leo.

Josh turns and looks at the phone.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Toby storms through.

STAFFER
Hey, Toby!

Toby lifts his hand in warning.

TOBY
[angry] Don't anybody talk to me right now.

He heads for JOSH'S OFFICE. JOSH is on the phone.

TOBY
Josh, Greg Summerhays was here to offer me a job. [yelling] Leo got me a
damned lifeboat!

Josh hangs up.

TOBY
[yelling] I'm gonna rip his arms off...

Josh turns towards Toby.

JOSH
[quietly] Toby...

TOBY
[yelling]...and beat him with his own...

JOSH
[quietly] That was Leo. He wants us over there. It's answer B.

Donna follows Josh out. Toby stands stunned for a moment then leaves. He
follows Josh
and Donna down the hall.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The TVs on stands are all airing the same program. The sounds of roaring
thunder are
heard.

REPORTER [VO]
...and First Lady had just concluded the interview. President Bartlet is
expected to be
arriving at the State Department for a press conference. Typically, a press
conference,
particularly this size, would be help in the East Room of the White House,
but we're told
there's some repairs going on there, so the change of venue. Chris Watson,
can you tell
us what we might expect to hear from the President in a few minutes? [fumbles
with his
earpiece] Wait... all right. Our apologies, we'll have Chris in a moment. Let's
go...

CUT TO: INT. THE LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo and Bartlet are walking inside.

LEO [gently]
Why don't you should sit in here for a few minutes.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
I'm gonna get C.J., you two'll do a last minute review.

BARTLET
I'm fine.

LEO
I'm gonna get C.J.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
[very gently] Sit here. Close your eyes for a few minutes. Charlie will get
you when
we're ready.

BARTLET
Yeah. [sits before the veranda door]

Leo exits and closes the door behind him. An agent stands outside. Bartlet
is shown on
the monitors, sitting with Abbey.

BARTLET [on T.V.]
... began experiencing blurred vision and numbness in my legs. Two years
and many tests
later, I was diagnosed with a course of relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis.

Toby is watching the television, Leo approaches him.

MAN [on T.V.]
That startling admission made just moments ago by President Bartlet...

LEO
Toby...

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Where's C.J.?

TOBY
She ran back to her office.

Leo looks at the television.

TOBY
They're gonna run this clip forever.

LEO
No, we're about to give them clips to beat it.

TOBY
Leo, you got me a lifeboat?

LEO
Greg Summerhays.

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Yeah, I got you a lifeboat.

TOBY
Do you imagine there are any circumstances under which I would use it?

LEO
No.

TOBY
Then why?

LEO
To show him that. [heads for the door, stops and turns to Toby.] C.J.'s in
her office?

TOBY
You think he's gonna change his mind, don't you? You think he's gonna run?

LEO
C.J.'s in her office?

TOBY
Yeah.

Leo leaves.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The President is looking out at the rain. Knocking on the door.

BARTLET
Yeah!

MARGARET
[enters, stands before him] Mr. President, you wanted to see Donna Moss?

BARTLET
Yeah.

Donna walks in. Margaret leaves.

DONNA
Good evening, sir.

BARTLET
How are you?

DONNA
Fine, thank you, sir. We all thought you did very well.

BARTLET
That was the easy part.

DONNA
It didn't look that easy.

BARTLET
[as they sit facing each other] Talk about the weather.

DONNA
[clears throat softly] A tropical storm is a cyclone in which the maximum
sustained
surface speed of the wind is 34 nautical miles per hour.

BARTLET
And there's a tropical storm seizing, right?

DONNA
Yes, sir, it's June 1st to November 30th.

BARTLET
Okay, and how many times say, in the last hundred years, has a tropical
storm come off
the Atlantic seaboard to Washington in the middle of May?

DONNA
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it hasn't
happened in
the last century.

BARTLET
At all?

DONNA
No, sir.

Knocking on the door. Donna stands up apprehensively. C.J. enters.

C.J.
Excuse me, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah. Thank you, Donna.

DONNA
Thank you, Mr. President. [exits]

BARTLET
According to the NOAA, the storm is a non-recurring phenomenon, which is
science's term
for 'we don't know what in the world is going on, but we're stocking up on
canned goods.'

C.J.
I just wanted to review a few things.

BARTLET
This is stuff you don't think I'd remember from an hour ago?

C.J.
You'll want to take the first question from Lawrence Altman, the Times'
Chief Medical
Correspondent.

BARTLET
Why?

C.J.
Because if you call on anyone else, the first question will be about
reelection. Call on
Altman, it will be a medical question, it'll have two or three
follow-ups. It'll allow
you to feel comfortable a little before you start with the political mess.
Bartlet scoffs.

C.J.
Altman will be in the front row, first seat on your right.

BARTLET
Okay. [walks away and looks aside]

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah?

C.J.
Where's Altman going to be?

BARTLET
C.J....

C.J.
Mr. President, I'm going there right now. This is the last time I'm going
to see you
before you step up... please, where's Altman going to be?

BARTLET
First seat on the right.

C.J.
Whose right?

BARTLET
My right.

C.J.
Thank you, sir. [exits]

Thunder roaring. Bartlet hears knocking.

CUT TO: INT. THE BARTLET RESIDENCE, 1960s - NIGHT
Young Jed is knocking on his father's office door - once, twice, three times.

DR. BARTLET [VO]
Come in.

Dr. Bartlet is sitting in an armchair reading a newspaper, as Jed enters
and approaches
the other chair.

DR. BARTLET
[reading] "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you will
never learn."
Is this your quote?

JED
Dad, uh, I wanted to mention something to you that maybe you weren't aware
of regarding
salary acquisitions...

DR. BARTLET
Is this your quote? "If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and
you will never
learn."

JED
It's actually Ray Bradbury.

DR. BARTLET
And you quoted Ray Bradbury?

JED
Yes.

DR. BARTLET
In an article you and your friends wrote, condemning professor Loomis.

JED
[sits] For banning certain books from the library, yes.

DR. BARTLET
He is a professor of literature!

JED
He banned Henry Miller! He banned D.H. Lawrence.

DR. BARTLET
Yes.

JED
"Giovanni's Room" 'cause it's too homosexual!

DR. BARTLET
Stop it right now. You're a guest at this school.

JED
I'm a student at this school.

DR. BARTLET
Jed!

JED
He banned "Fahrenheit 451," which is about banning books!

DR. BARTLET
Was that supposed to be funny?

He stands, Jed stands after him.

DR. BARTLET
That word play you just did there, was that meant to be funny?

JED
That was supposed to...

Dr. Bartlet slaps him across the face.

DR. BARTLET
Was there anything else?

JED
[quetly, looking away] It's not a nondenominational service.

DR. BARTLET
Don't start with this. [walks over to his desk]

JED
Catholics don't believe man is saved through faith alone. Catholics believe
that faith
has to be joined with good works.

DR. BARTLET
You're the only one who seems to mind the service.

JED
I'm the only one who's Catholic.

DR. BARTLET
You're Catholic because your mother is, and you're at the school because
I'm the
headmaster. How's that for clever with words? [sits down] But what was it
you came in
here to talk to me about?

JED
Nothing.

DR. BARTLET
Please close the door behind you.

Jed shuts the door to his father's office.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT
President Bartlet closes the door behind C.J. in THE OVAL OFFICE. Thunder
roars.
Bartlet walks to lean on his desk, places hands among the many pictures on
it.
Suddenly, the wind blows the veranda door wide open and rain pours in.

BARTLET
Ah... Damn it! Mrs. Landingham!

He turns away, realizing she won't come to his call, and then the door
opens...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[walks in, small and resolute] I really wish you wouldn't shout,
Mr. President.

BARTLET
[beat, as he looks at her in disbelief] The door keeps blowing open.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yes, but there's an intercom and you could use it to call me at my desk.

BARTLET
I was...

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You don't know how to use the intercom.

BARTLET
It's not that I don't know how to use it, it's just that I haven't learned
yet.

She looks at him and he smiles shyly, as if he's been caught lying.

BARTLET
I have MS, and I didn't tell anybody.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
Yeah. So, you're having a little bit of a day.

BARTLET
You're gonna make jokes?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
God doesn't make cars crash, and you know it. Stop using me as an excuse.

BARTLET
[motions her to sit and sits down] The party's not going to want me to run.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
The party'll come back. You'll get them back.

BARTLET
I've got a secret for you, Mrs. Landingham I've never been the most popular
guy in the
Democratic Party.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
[sits opposite from him] I've got a secret for you, Mr. President your father
was a prick
who could never get over the fact that he wasn't as smart as his brothers. Are
you in a
tough spot? Yes. Do I feel sorry for you? I do not. Why? Because there are
people way
worse off than you.

BARTLET
Give me numbers.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
I don't know numbers. You give them to me.

BARTLET
How about a child born this minute has one in five chance of being born into
poverty?

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans don't have health insurance?

BARTLET
44 million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
What's the number one cause of death for black men under 35?

BARTLET
Homicide.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans are behind bars?

BARTLET
Three million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
How many Americans are drug addicts?

BARTLET
Five million.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
And one of five kids in poverty?

BARTLET
That's 13 million American children.

CUT TO: INT. CRANE SHOT OF THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
President Bartlet is talking, and the opposite chair is empty.

BARTLET
3.5 million kids go to schools that are literally falling apart. We need
127 billion in
school construction, and we need it today!

MRS. LANDINGHAM
To say nothing of the 53 people trapped in the embassy.

BARTLET
Yes.

MRS. LANDINGHAM
You know, if you don't want to run again, I respect that. [stands up] But
if you don't
run 'cause you think it's gonna be too hard or you think you're gonna lose -
well, God,
Jed, I don't even want to know you.

Mrs. Landingham walks out and gently closes the Oval Office door behind
her. President
Bartlet stands, walks into the open door onto the veranda and lets the rain
wash over
his face.

CHARLIE [VO]
Mr President!

Charlie appears with a coat that he's holding unwrapped.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, it's time.

Bartlet avoids the coat and walks into another door. Charlie follows him. At
his desk,
he leaves the coat and takes off his own as well.

The song 'Brothers in Arms' by Dire Straits plays softly.

	These mist covered mountains
	Are a home now for me,
	But my home is the lowlands
	And always will be.
	Some day you'll return to
	Your valleys and your farms
	And you'll no longer burn
	To be brothers in arms...

Leo joins the President walking. Josh, Sam and Toby follow.

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
C.J. is on the podium in front of a filled room.

C.J.
And he'll be speaking to that just as soon as he gets here. [Reporters
clamoring.]
Uh, Frank, then Leslie.

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
The President is in the limo.

	Through these fields of destruction,
	Baptisms of fire,
	I've witnessed your suffering
	As the battles raged higher.
	And though they did hurt me so bad
	In the fear and alarm,
	You did not desert me,
	My brothers in arms...

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

FRANK
Has there been any discussion of a Special Prosecutor?

C.J.
Tomorrow morning, the President will direct the Attorney General appoint a
Special
Prosecutor, yes. [Reporters clamor.] I can't see. Joan!

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
The limo is driving in the rain, guards all around it. Leo looks at Bartlet
worriedly.

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
A list of three prosecutors is given to a three-judge panel. The prosecutors,
as well
as the judges, were all appointed by Republican presidents.

Reporters clamor, as Donna and Margaret, pale and dressed in coats, tear
through the
crowd and stand at a distance.

C.J.
Please, I can only answer 14 or 15 questions at once. Hal!

CUT TO: INT. NATIONAL CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS
A janitor is washing the floor and stumbles upon a cigarette. He lifts it
and looks
outside as sirens announce the President's passing. Limos and lights are
seen through
open doors of the Cathedral.

	There's so many different worlds,
	So many different suns,
	And we have just one world
	But we live in different ones...

CUT TO: INT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
I can't comment on a witness list that doesn't exist, but I imagine subpoenas
will be
issued to most Senior White House Staff including myself.

Reporters clamor.

CUT TO: EXT. THE STATE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
The President arrives in the rain, slowly walks in. Everyone follows him,
no umbrellas
are in sight.

	Now the sun's gone to hell
	And the moon's riding high,
	Let me bid you farewell -
	Every man has to die...

Bartlet is given a towel and he wipes his face with it, as he, followed by
Charlie, Leo,
Toby, Sam, Josh, and several Secret Service agents, heads for the conference
room.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESS CONFERENCE - CONTINUOUS

C.J.
Again, I can't comment on what kind of hearings Congress has in mind. I'm
sure there'll
be one but you'd have to talk to Congress.

Carol gives her a slight nod as she spots the President approaching.

C.J.
Okay, here now, the President of the United States.

Everyone stands in silence as Bartlet walks up to the podium. He passes C.J.

C.J.
[quietly] First row on your right.

	But it's written in the starlight
	And every line on your palm
	We're fools to make war
	On our brothers in arms...

Bartlet looks over the room. He sees Lawrence Altman, waiting to be called.
Instead, he points to the center of the room.

BARTLET
Yes, Sandy.

C.J. watches in shock.

SANDY
Mr. President, can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

BARTLET
I'm sorry, Sandy, there was a bit of noise there, could you repeat the
question?

SANDY
Can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?

Charlie, C.J., Josh and Sam, Donna and Margaret, Toby and Leo all watch.
Leo turns to the monitor.

LEO
Watch this...

They are all waiting, watching, as Bartlet slides his hands off the podium,
puts them
in his pockets, looks away and smiles.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
