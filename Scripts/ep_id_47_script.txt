FADE IN: EXT. MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - DAY

CUT TO: INT. A BARN IN THE BARTLET FARM - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and his staff are in the barn practicing a speech.

BARTLET
[reading] We are more than a set of borders. We are bounded by the reach of
human
freedom. We have mastered every moment. We have vanquished every foe. We
are strong.
We are prosperous. We are at peace with the world. We are, as we have ever
been, the
envy of every civilization. We are, as we have ever been, the hope of all
mankind. But
I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before not to speak
of the America
we have, but of the Amer....

TOBY
Excuse me?

BARTLET
Yeah?

TOBY
We are the envy of every civilization?

DOUG
Yeah.

TOBY
(laughs) Really?

DOUG
They don't vote in England, Toby.

SAM
Well, they do, actually.

CONNIE
He meant that...

TOBY
We know what he meant. Thank you.

SAM
(to Bartlet) I'll change it, sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

TOBY
(indicating Doug) Could somebody stick some pom-poms in that guy's hands?

BARTLET
(reading) "But I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. And I come before
you not to
speak of the America we have, but of the better, stronger, more prosperous
America we
can create together."

C.J.
There's a snake over there. (All look.)

SAM
(walking toward it) What kind?

C.J.
I don't know and I don't want to ask him. Can somebody shoot it, please?

SAM
(looking at it) Probably a garter snake.

BARTLET
It's a garter snake. Don't worry about it.

C.J.
Okay.

BARTLET
(reading) "I seek re-election to the presidency, not because of its glories,
but because
of its challenges..."

DOUG
And I have a problem here.

BARTLET
Yeah?

SAM
I wrote that.

DOUG
(sarcastically) I'm happy for you. (to Bartlet) "It's challenges" make it
sound like
you're overwhelmed by the job and this is exactly the wrong time for that.

SAM
No. It's exactly the right time to raise the stakes of the election.

DOUG
Why?

TOBY
Cause if it's all day at the beach, any bozo with a handshake can do it.

DOUG
I'm sorry but America wants a happy warrior to lead the country, not
Dr. Kevorkian.

JOSH
(to Bartlet) It's true, sir. America does not want Dr. Kervorkian to lead
the country.
We've got polling data on that.

BARTLET
All right. We'll revisit that.

C.J.
The snake is looking at me now.

BARTLET
(reading) "A presidential candidate owes his campaign no less than he owes
his country;
everything he has, everything he can give, all his hope...

DOUG
(wincing) Again, I'm sorry, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah?

DOUG
I'm not wild about it being "your" campaign and "your" country.

CONNIE
No, that's okay.

DOUG
People don't hear that well.

SAM
The people who're going to be there hear fine.

CONNIE
No, he doesn't mean people don't "hear" that well. He means people don't hear
"that" well.
But I disagree.

JOSH
Okay, I see the snake now, too.

TOBY
Sir, you're perfectly entitled to declare yourself the leader of the campaign
and the
country, since, after all, you are.

Leo and Bruno walk into the barn.

DOUG
But if it's him and not the voters, then it points the pundits towards the
M.S.

BRUNO
I think the cat's out of the bag on the M.S.

BARTLET
(joking) Does somebody her have M.S. and they haven't said anything?

JOSH
Seriously, that's a pretty big snake.

BARTLET
(reading) "But I am not satisfied." Indeed, Leo, I am close to taking my
own life with
a wheat thresher.

LEO
Bruno?

BRUNO
Yeah. Uh, listen up. I've been thinking it might not be such a bad idea to
lock you all
in here and set the place on fire. We have 48 hours before we kick off this
campaign.
We will work hard. We will work well. We will work together. Or so help me,
mother of
God, I will stick a pitchfork so far up your asses, you will, quite simply,
be dead.

BARTLET
"And so with pride and purpose, I hereby announce my candidacy for the
presidency of the
United States."

ACT ONE

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

	FOUR WEEKS EARLIER

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Soft music is playing. Bartlet walks into his room and through it to the
bathroom,
passing Abbey, who is reading a book in bed.

ABBEY
Jed?

BARTLET
[comes out swiftly] I didn't see you there...

ABBEY
Yeah.

BARTLET
I didn't see you.

ABBEY
What's going on?

BARTLET
Peter thinks sanctions are a waste of time and I agree. In about half an
hour we're
buzzing the island with... uh, what they call an Alpha strike formation -
to show
Bazan... I don't know. [goes into the bathroom]

ABBEY
Will it work? [beat] Jed?

BARTLET [VO]
Yeah?

ABBEY
I said will it work?

BARTLET
[comes out with a towel] Sorry, I said I don't know, we'll see.

ABBEY
C.J. got beaten up pretty good in the Briefing Room.

BARTLET
Yeah, it was bound to happen. [goes back into the bathroom]

ABBEY
Maybe you want to think about sitting her down for a few days. [beat] Jed?

BARTLET [VO]
Yeah?

ABBEY
I said maybe you want to think about benching C.J. for a few days!

BARTLET [VO]
Yeah.

ABBEY
At least on Haiti.

BARTLET
Ah, it's Leo's call.

ABBEY
Send in Nancy or Peter or someone from State? That way the two stories don't
get mixed up.

BARTLET
[comes out] Yeah, it's Leo's call. Look, I'm sorry, I can't get into our
thing tonight.

ABBEY
Two days ago you said you had a lot to say.

BARTLET
I do, that's why I can't get into it. I have to read.

ABBEY
That's all right.

BARTLET
All right, I'm going to the study. [heads out]

ABBEY
Okay.

BARTLET
[turns] Abbey, you were lying down when I came in. I didn't see you.

ABBEY
I believe you.

Bartlet leaves as Abbey closes her eyes.

CUT TO: EXT. BARTLET FAMILY FARM, MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - PRESENT

CUT TO: INT. NEW HAMPSHIRE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Josh walks into a room in the house where senior staffers and consultants
are already
present.

DOUG [VO]
He has to sell the greatness of America.

SAM [VO]
Why?

DOUG [VO]
Because it's an implicit argument to stay the course.

SAM
We're selling the greatness of America.

DOUG
Not enough.

SAM
We're selling it in paragraphs one, two, eight, sixteen, twenty-six,
thirty-six...

DOUG
Listen, it's a simple equation. Bartlet rules America. America rocks,
therefore,
Bartlet rocks.

SAM
America "rocks?"

TOBY
Bartlet... "rocks?"

DOUG
Yes.

JOSH
He really doesn't... that much. Leo? Can I see you for a second?

LEO
Yeah.

Leo follows Josh into the hallway. Doug sighs.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Leo and Josh stand at the bottom of a ladder.

JOSH
RU-486.

LEO
There's nothing we can do...

JOSH
The last thing we need is to come out of the gate waving a flag to the
American
heartland...

LEO
Look, Josh...

JOSH
...saying we don't share your values.

LEO
The President understands all that.

JOSH
And?

LEO
That's the way it goes. [walks off]

JOSH
[follows him] Leo!

LEO
The FDA is an independent agency. They can announce when they want.

JOSH
The FDA is a division of HHS and technically not an independent agency.

LEO
Technically?

JOSH
I can keep the President away from this. I can call the FDA's chief of staff,
I got
him his job... They can wait...

LEO
No!

JOSH
Two weeks - to announce the drug. They don't have to do it on Monday. I can
fix tobacco.

LEO
Tobacco?

JOSH
[absently] No, I meant 486.

LEO
Leave the FDA alone.

Leo leaves, as Josh sighs heavily.

CUT TO: EXT. BARTLET FAMILY FARM - DAY
A car pulls up to the farm. C.J. gets out and approaches Abbey.

C.J.
Good morning!

ABBEY
Hi, C.J.!

C.J.
You just get in?

ABBEY
Oh, a few hours ago.

C.J.
Ellie and Zoey are here?

Abbey walks to the house with a basket full of apples. C.J. follows.

ABBEY
Yeah. Liz will be here in a while. We're going for a hike later if you want
to join us.

C.J.
No, thank you, I can't. But I do want to talk to you about a photo-op.

ABBEY
Would you like some cider?

C.J.
No, I'm fine.

ABBEY
We grow the apples right down the hill. It's good.

C.J.
Okay. So, at any rate...

ABBEY
The photo-op.

C.J.
Yes.

ABBEY
My husband and I, together.

C.J.
Yeah.

ABBEY
With the kids.

C.J.
That'd be nice if...

ABBEY
Because my husband and I came to the house separately there were photos of
the President
getting on the plane alone.

C.J.
Ma'am, this is uncomfortable territory and obviously, I... The press has
sources that
say that you and the President...

ABBEY
Do we have names?

C.J.
I'm sorry?

ABBEY
The sources.

C.J.
No, these are...

ABBEY
Unnamed sources. C.J., unnamed sources make me crazy. Just one time, I'd
like to see...
instead of "according to unnamed sources" I'd like to see according to tweaky
little
ill-informed chicken-ass wannabe... Don't ever come to me again with unnamed
sources,
C.J. You don't get any cider. [walks away]

C.J.
Yes, ma'am.

CUT TO: INT. NEW HAMPSHIRE HOUSE - DAY

C.J. [VO]
I spoke to the First Lady before.

LEO
Hmmm?

C.J.
I spoke to the First Lady. I thought it might not be a bad idea if there
were some
opportunities with the two of them together at the house.

LEO
What was her reaction?

C.J.
Well, she denied me cider.

C.J. follows Leo outside into the STREET.

LEO
What else?

C.J.
I'll brief the Sunday papers on what they can expect from the speech on
Monday.

LEO
You know it's not written yet.

C.J.
I'm just giving them highlights.

LEO
What highlights?

C.J.
I'll make them up!

LEO
Okay.

C.J.
I thought maybe you could speak to her.

They cross the street.

LEO
Who?

C.J.
The First Lady.

LEO
Look, I...

C.J.
Every paper today had a picture on the front page of the President boarding
Air Force One
to go home by himself.

LEO
It's a Saturday paper.

C.J.
There are any number of press questions about...

LEO
We're two private men, C.J. We don't talk about our marriages. What do you
want from me?

C.J.
I'm not wild about the fact that you told Toby what we discussed.

LEO
He's the communications director, you don't think he should know?

C.J.
When I think it's time...

LEO
[angrily] When I think it's time I will tell anyone who works for me anything
I damn
please! You know what, C.J.? Stop being pissed at me about Haiti. [walks away]

C.J.
Yeah, okay.

She walks in the opposite direction.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - FOUR WEEKS EARLIER
The entrance is viewed through a security monitor.

LEO [VO]
It's a surrender.

BARTLET [VO]
It's not a surrender if he has demands.

LEO
It's as close as we come these days.

BARTLET
What does he want?

LEO
Ten million dollars US, a private plane and a guarantee we won't be prosecuted
for the
war crimes.

BARTLET
What else?

Bartlet and Leo enter the room.

LEO
Asylum for himself and sixty of his family members.

BARTLET
Where?!

LEO
Here.

BARTLET
Well, that's a bit of a dilemma. Does anybody have room at their place for
Bazan and
sixty of his relatives?

MIKE
Sir, any amnesty conditions could be in violation of Haiti treaties.

BARTLET
Yeah.

PETER
Do we want to set a precedent that anyone can stage a coup and walk away if
it doesn't
work?

MIKE
And with ten million dollars and a private plane?

NANCY
A shoot-out in the Presidential Palace is the worst possible outcome. Bazan's
full
surrender is the best and that's what we've got on the table.

BARTLET
I want to handle this peacefully and right now. Nancy, what do you think of
Venezuela?

NANCY
Venezuela would like to be considered a resource for supplying Strategic
Petroleum
Reserves.

BARTLET
Tell them I'll give the SPR strong consideration. Mike, have the Canadians
get a message
through: we'll unfreeze his US accounts but he can't remove any money from
Haiti. Only
his wife, his children and his parents can seek asylum. If he tries to go
back, he'll be
under arrest.

LEO
And he can screw the private plane. We'll fly him on a C-9 from Port-au-Prince
to Caracas
and if he's very good we won't shoot him in the head on the way.

BARTLET
Tell me when it's done.

NANCY
Yes, sir.

EVERYONE
Thank you, Mr. President.

LEO
Nancy?

NANCY
Yeah.

LEO
Let me talk to you a second.

They walk out of the room together.

LEO
When this is a done deal, I want you to stick around for a while and brief
the press.

NANCY
She made a mistake, Leo.

LEO
I'm not punishing her.

NANCY
She made a mistake...

LEO
I'm not punishing her! You're not the political face of this administration,
you're no
part of the MS thing and you won't be asked questions about it.

NANCY
I don't feel right about this.

LEO
I don't care. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT
Sam walks to Margaret's desk.

MARGARET
Hey.

SAM
Can I talk to him?

MARGARET
He's on his way up from the Sit Room.

SAM
Hey, good news about Haiti.

MARGARET
I say we should have gone in there with four tank divisions and turned the
place into
a casino.

SAM
Manifest Destiny?

MARGARET
Bet your ass.

LEO
[walks in] Calls?

MARGARET
On your desk.

SAM
You got a second?

Sam follows Leo in LEO'S OFFICE.

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
So, I wanted to apologize about before.

LEO
Don't worry about it.

SAM
You know what I'm talking about?

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
So I wanted to make you aware of something.

LEO
Yeah.

SAM
Well, I've looked through the transcript a couple of times, and he never
apologized.

LEO
What do you mean?

SAM
In the interview - he never apologized and I think that's something we're
going to be
humbled with later.

LEO
Well, let's wait a few weeks, see what happens with the numbers and take
another look.

SAM
Yeah.

LEO
Anything else?

SAM
He wanted a private plane?

LEO
Can you believe it?

Sam chuckles as Leo walks out of the office. Sam leaves.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks in to see Bartlet.

BARTLET
The State Department's suggesting that we praise the French government for
their help
in resolving this matter. I would, but I'm worried they'd surrender.

LEO
You did well, Mr. President.

Leo follows Bartlet out to the PORTICO.

BARTLET
When do you think C.J. can brief?

LEO
Nancy can brief.

BARTLET
Yeah?

LEO
Don't worry about it. You did well.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

CUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo walks inside and hands C.J. notes.

LEO
We haven't picked up any ground in Iowa, Kansas, Arkansas, and Illinois.

C.J.
It's only been a week.

LEO
Yeah, but we struck the agricultural trade deal with Argentina and the farm
country
ought to love that.

C.J.
Well, that story got a little drowned out.

LEO
Yes, it did.

Leo walks out of the office into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. C.J. follows.

C.J.
I could have stood on top of the Sears Tower with a Stratacaster and that
story would
have been drowned out!

LEO
I'm not assigning blame.

C.J.
Really?

LEO
Yes. We need help. I'm bringing in Bruno Gianelli.

C.J.
It's too early for Bruno.

LEO
No.

C.J.
Toby, Sam and Josh... the guys aren't gonna like it!

LEO
They'll have to live with it.

Leo leaves, as C.J. goes back to her office and closes the door.

CUT TO: INT. BARTLET FAMILY FARM HOUSE - PRESENT
Leo is reading some papers, and Doug, Toby and Sam can be seen two rooms back,
arguing.

DOUG
"I say to you today, I love this country and I will make sure our military
continues
to be the best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world."

SAM
Oh my god.

TOBY
I think Sam wants to take this one.

SAM
If you want to substitute 'testosterone' for foreign policy...

DOUG
I'm not...

CUT TO: INT. THE OTHER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Connie is standing with papers in her hand.

SAM
You want to have the President wade out into the crowd and challenge it to
an arm-wrestle?

CONNIE
The problem is the foreign policy section was too long.

DOUG
And there are no votes in foreign policy!

SAM
You just wrote of 98 percent of the world's population and three quarters
of the
President's job description.

TOBY
It's that kind of thinking that makes us the envy of every civilization.

SAM
[throws the speech away] Scrap this.

CONNIE
I have a problem here.

SAM
Where?

CONNIE
[reads] "This campaign must not be about the disease God gave me, but the
opportunities
God has given our country."

DOUG
You're going back to the strategy that failed for a month!

TOBY
What's that?

DOUG
All MS, all the time.

TOBY
It was a little damage control needed to be done.

DOUG
You couldn't stop educating the public. You guys are never happier than when
you're
educating the public!

TOBY
A month ago 74 percent of them thought MS was fatal.

DOUG
And every time you told them it wasn't, there was a story about MS! Just
change the
subject!

TOBY
[shouts] God, why the hell didn't I think of that?!

DOUG
I don't know, Toby, but if you had I'd probably wouldn't be here.

Toby stumbles and walks away. Doug looks frustrated.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OUTER OFFICE - FLASHBACK
Margaret is at her desk, when a man comes by.

MAN
Hello.

MARGARET
Yes?

MAN
I'm Bruno Gianelli.

MARGARET
[beat] Yes?

BRUNO
I have an appointment.

Margaret looks through her books, indicates Bruno should wait and steps into
Leo's office.

MARGARET [VO]
Who's Bruno Gianelli?

LEO [VO]
A strategist.

MARGARET [VO]
Really?

LEO [VO]
He got five senators elected, three governors. He got Hacket elected where
they haven't
elected a Democrat in 46 years. He got the Prime Minister of Israel elected
and it's
entirely possible that he's never voted in his life.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Leo is at his desk and Margaret's standing in front of him.

MARGARET
He's here.

LEO
[takes glasses off] Why didn't you send him in?

MARGARET
[adamantly] He didn't have an appointment.

LEO
I meant... I did it!

MARGARET
You did it yourself?

LEO
Yes.

MARGARET
And you're not supposed to do that, are you?

LEO
[shouts] Bruno!

Bruno walks in and shakes hands with Leo. Margaret leaves.

BRUNO
You people could find more ways to blow it.

LEO
We might be running out.

BRUNO
[as both sit] Nah, I don't think so.

LEO
Look.

BRUNO
Why the hell didn't you call me before the announcement?

LEO
What would you have done?

BRUNO
Told him not to make the announcement.

LEO
That'd be concealing the truth.

BRUNO
Ah, would it now?

LEO
[smiles] Can you help us?

BRUNO [nods]
I need to see your internals.

LEO
Joey Lucas has been polling every day for two months.

BRUNO
The girl?

LEO
Yeah.

BRUNO
I worked with her in California. She's good.

LEO
[beat] What do you want?

BRUNO
15 percent of the ad buys. You're gonna say, 10, so why don't we just say, 13?

LEO
Why don't we say 12?

BRUNO
Why don't we say 13? I want hiring and firing prerogatives in my department
and for
starters, I'm bringing in Doug Wegland and Connie Tate.

LEO
Fine.

BRUNO
A room at the Hay-Adams and a car and a driver.

LEO
Fine.

BRUNO
And I want unfettered access to the President.

LEO
No.

BRUNO
I need it.

LEO
Can't have it.

BRUNO
Leo, the only races I've ever lost are ones where the candidate didn't listen,
or the
advice didn't get through. That isn't gonna happen this time.

LEO
Can't do it.

BRUNO
This is ego, and you know it as well as I do. I take this request to the
President,
tell him it's a deal breaker, he's going to say yes.

LEO
Knock yourself out. [shouts] Margaret!

MARGARET
[comes in] Yes, sir.

LEO
Would you take Mr. Gianelli into the Oval Office please?

MARGARET
Sure.

BRUNO
[to Leo] Are you playing with me?

Leo smiles.

MARGARET
Mr. Gianelli, would you follow me, please?

BRUNO
Sure.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is reading in a chair. Bruno walks in.

BARTLET
[stands] Bruno!

BRUNO
Good morning, Mr. President. [They shake hands.]

BARTLET
I understand you're going to be working with us.

BRUNO
Well, sir, obviously I'm pleased to be approached. I believe there's a great
deal I can
do for you.

BARTLET
You have one or two demands.

BRUNO
Yes, sir. [They sit in the opposing chairs.]

BARTLET
You want 12 percent of the ad buys.

BRUNO
[beat] Okay. 12, and...

BARTLET
A room, a car, and a driver, that's no problem.

BRUNO
Well, thank you, sir. I'll also need unfettered access to...

BARTLET
No.

BRUNO
Sir, I...

BARTLET
I'm sorry, Bruno. Leo runs the show.

BRUNO
Respectfully, sir...

BARTLET
It's a deal breaker.

BRUNO
Okay. Anyone else I have to field things through? [beat] I was sorry to hear
about
Dolores Landingham.

BARTLET
Can you help us out?

BRUNO
Yes, sir.

They stand and shake hands again.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MARGARET
Do I need to explain the rules on making appointments again? Are you confused?

LEO
[annoyed] Get out!

MARGARET
[leaving] I'll jot them down.

Bruno returns to Leo's office.

LEO
How'd it go?

BRUNO
Shut up.

LEO
What's first?

They walk out into the HALLWAY.

BRUNO
We get together in a room.

LEO
After that?

BRUNO
An event.

LEO
How's two weeks from Monday?

BRUNO
Is that the soonest we can do it?

LEO
Yeah.

BRUNO
Okay. We'll scout locations in New Hampshire. Maybe a high school.

CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL, MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - DAY
A school band is playing a theme song and waving flags. There are guards
with dogs,
people preparing for the event everywhere, putting up balloons and signs.

BRUNO
Sam!

SAM
[runs up]Yeah!

BRUNO
"Columbia, Gem of the Ocean?" Is he christening a minesweeper?

SAM
It was part of the deal.

BRUNO
What deal?

SAM
They're the Columbia high school marching band, they get to play their song.

BRUNO
We had to negotiate with the band?

SAM
Look...

BRUNO
They're going to be live on four networks. They will play what we want to
hear.

Toby comes up with a big sign.

TOBY
Bruno!

BRUNO
Hey, how you doing?

TOBY
Good. Whose throat do I shove these down? Whose skull do I crack with this
sign?

BRUNO
Don't worry about it.

TOBY
"Bartlet for President."

BRUNO
Yeah, we'll get rid of it.

TOBY
[backs away] Good, 'cause I was there when he won. I saw him get sworn in,
I actually
rode in a limo...

BRUNO
Write me a speech, would you? One that doesn't make me think I'm sitting
Shiva someplace,
black curtains on the mirrors?

Toby gives him a 'fed up' sign and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
C.J. and Josh walk in.

C.J.
We'll be using this as the Green room. He can walk right out the door and
up on stage.

JOSH
What's this room usually used for?

C.J.
I don't know: desks, a black board, could be some kind of a classroom?

JOSH
C.J....

C.J.
Yeah.

JOSH
What's going on?

C.J.
What do you mean? [beat] Nothing.

JOSH
You sure?

C.J.
Yeah.

C.J. walks outside. Josh follows.

C.J.
What's going on with RU-486?

JOSH
Leo won't let me wave off the FDA.

C.J.
That's against the law.

They walk out to the STAGE AREA. People are busy all around.

JOSH
[throws his arms open] Yeah, I'm not talking about sticking out the fruit
stand -
a phone call, a favor from a friend. I know the Chief of Staff at the
subcommittee,
I got him his job.

C.J.
You mean the FDA?

JOSH
This is the second time this weekend I've done that.

TOBY [VO]
Hey, see this? [comes up] This why I didn't want to do an announcement.

He holds up a sign "Bartlet for President" on which he crossed out "FOR"
with a black
marker and wrote "IS THE" instead.

C.J.
[passing him by with Josh] We're taking care of it.

TOBY
No, I'm taking care of it.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - FLASHBACK
Strategists and Senior Staff are inside, along with Kenny and Joey Lucas.

TOBY
I want to say for maybe the eighteenth time that I don't an announcement
event at all.

DOUG
If he's going to run for reelection than he's got to announce he's going to
run for
reelection.

TOBY
He did that two weeks ago.

BRUNO
He's not gaining enough ground which means he's bleeding.

JOSH
If we put him up there like any other candidate, we trade away the one big
advantage
we've got.

DOUG
What's that?

TOBY
He's the President already?

DOUG
Signing executive orders and decorating a tree isn't gonna do it!

BRUNO
Fellas, I'm getting old over here. This subject was closed on Tuesday.

DOUG
He's gotta stand up, and he's gotta declare, and he's gotta apologize.

TOBY
He's not going to apologize.

DOUG
Why not?

TOBY
For what?

DOUG
For your campaign and your White House perpetrating a fraud.

Toby and Joey look at him apprehensively.

DOUG
I'm from Oregon. In Oregon, we like to see a man stand up and say he's sorry.
Where are you from?

TOBY
Me?

DOUG
Yeah!

TOBY
I'm from the United States of suck my...

JOSH
All right! Let's take lunch.

Everyone packs their papers and stands up.

DOUG
Republicans talk about how arrogant you guys are. I always thought it was
the natural
reaction that comes from not getting the girl. I can't believe how much
they've been
low-balling it.

BRUNO
Josh!

JOSH
Yeah.

BRUNO
Wait up. Let me walk you to your office.

JOSH
Sure.

Bruno and Josh walk out to the HALLWAYS.

BRUNO
You know, he had a point.

JOSH
Who?

BRUNO
Doug.

JOSH
That we're arrogant?

BRUNO
Yeah.

JOSH
I guess that means Doug won't be coming to my sweet sixteen then.

BRUNO
[smiles] You were the one who sent them the press releases, right?

JOSH
What press releases?

BRUNO
Subcommittee. About tobacco.

JOSH
Yes, I was.

BRUNO
Well, that was stupid.

JOSH
You think?

BRUNO
No, I know.

JOSH
I got two years as legislative director in the House, two years as floor
director in
the Senate, and thirty months as Deputy Chief of Staff. What do you got?

BRUNO
Josh...

Josh stops to sign a document a staffer hands him.

JOSH
Kalmbach's a fat-ass Rotarian gasbag. I knew once I sent the thing he'd
raise the
profile and give us the press we needed.

BRUNO
Kalmbach is vulnerable in his home state. He's got an influx of tech and
other clean
industries along his Route Nine corridor, along with the suburban voters
that go with
it - affluent parents that who don't want their kids smoking.

They reach JOSH'S OFFICE. Josh sits.

JOSH
We got the money, Bruno.

BRUNO
You don't want the money. You want the issue. [sits] You should have waited
until the
fall when the bell rings and then we hammer them with it. Then Kalmbach,
Leder, Ross,
Roark, Steve - whoever gets the nomination - has it hanging around their
necks they're
nicotine pushers. Plus, you get the money. The sooner you get I know what
I'm talking
about, and I'm on your side, the sooner your world gets better. Of course,
you got the
money. I'm amazed they didn't send it to you with candy and a
stripper. Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Ohio - three swing states you could have brought over with
that. That's an
election.

Bruno gets up and leaves as Josh ponders his words.

CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
Limos drive up as Abbey is standing correcting a speech. Bartlet and Charlie
climb out
of a limo.

CHARLIE
You still get nervous talking in front of big crowds?

BARTLET
I've never been nervous talking in front of big crowds. It's talking to one
person...
[sees Abbey] I didn't know she was going to be here. [walks up to her]
I didn't know
you were going to be here.

ABBEY
I'm introducing you.

BARTLET
I thought Leo was gonna...

ABBEY
Well, C.J. thought it would be good.

BARTLET
Okay.

ABBEY
I... I can tell them...

BARTLET
No, I think it's a good idea.

ABBEY
Okay. You need to reach out to the staff. Once you do that, they'll feel
better, and
then so will you. I'm going back to the house.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK
Abbey is on an ottoman, and Bartlet is in a chair reading.

ABBEY
What are you reading?

BARTLET
I don't know enough about agriculture.

ABBEY
I wouldn't worry about it, agriculture isn't really your field.

BARTLET
Yeah, well, agriculture is responsible for one in five American jobs, so it
is a little
bit my field.

ABBEY
You know... [gets up]

BARTLET
15 percent of the world's cotton, 25 percent of the world's beef, and 50
percent of
the world's soybeans are grown in my field; farmers and ranchers pay taxes
in my field,
their kids go to school in my field, they go to jail in my field. From time
to time they
go to war in my field.

ABBEY
Jed...

BARTLET
So when I say 'it's not my field,' I'm not saying something, I'm trying to
learn so I can.

ABBEY
Why won't you talk to me?

BARTLET
Why aren't you with me?

ABBEY
How do you know I'm not?

BARTLET
You're not.

ABBEY
You're pissed at me?

BARTLET
I'm trying to read here.

ABBEY
You're pissed at me! I don't believe it! I don't believe you!

BARTLET
Abbey...

ABBEY
I don't believe you. You go from 'I've got a lot to say' to 'I can't say it
right now
because I've got so much to say' to 'I gotta read, I've got agriculture'
and 'you're
not with me' and go to hell...

BARTLET
Look...

ABBEY
Now that's an extraordinary evolution!

BARTLET
[rolls his eyes] Can I go a week without explaining myself?

ABBEY
You can go as long as you want without explaining yourself. Read your book.

BARTLET
Sit down, we'll talk about it right now.

ABBEY
I'm not in the mood, jackass. [turns away]

BARTLET
[sarcastically] Isn't there any way I could change your mind, 'cause I really
had my
heart set on it.

ABBEY
Go to hell. [leaves]

CUT TO: EXT. COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL - PRESENT
Leo walks up to Bartlet.

LEO
You feel all right?

BARTLET
Yeah. C.J. wants her to introduce me.

LEO
Yeah, I thought it was a good idea, too.

BARTLET
I wouldn't mind a little... you know. There's gonna be a big crowd here
tomorrow.

LEO
Well, that's your kind of crowd.

BARTLET
I need to finish the speech.

He walks off to sit in one of the folding chairs.

LEO
Yeah.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby stands in Sam's doorway.

TOBY
What are you doing?

SAM
Hmm?

TOBY
What are you doing? (beat) Going over the transcript?

SAM
He needs to apologize.

TOBY
Don't worry about it.

SAM
He lied.

TOBY
He didn't lie. It's what your people call a "sin of omission."

SAM
I'm not Catholic. (walks to Toby) It's what everybody calls a sin of
omission.
Bartlet lied to us.

TOBY
President Bartlet, Sam. Come on. Did you know that many Multiple Sclerosis
advocates
actually instruct victims to hide the illness because it's so misunderstood?

SAM
You think they instruct presidential candidates to do that?

They walk down the HALLWAY.

TOBY
I don't.

SAM
That night he told you?

TOBY
Yeah?

SAM
Didn't you feel like...

TOBY
I went crazy. I whaled on him in the Oval Office.

SAM
None of us had the chance to do that.

TOBY
I know.

SAM
We could have gotten it done. If he just told us at the beginning, this
could have been
a whole different...

TOBY
Yeah. Go home. (walks away)

SAM
All right.

CUT TO: EXT: BARTLET FAMILY FARM - NIGHT
Sam is near a fence. Connie drives up in her car.

CONNIE
Hey.

SAM
Hey.

CONNIE
What are you doing?

SAM
Talking to myself.

CONNIE
I'll join you.

SAM
Feel free.

Connie gets out of the car.

CONNIE
I thought the speech was locked. They're still up at the house arguing.

SAM
It's not locked 'til the president says it's locked.

CONNIE
Hmm. I was trying to find a Starbucks. A guy in a gas station said, "Round
here, people
don't pay four bucks for a cup of coffee."

SAM
New Hampshire. Live free or cheap.

CONNIE
Doug means well, you know. And he's smart.

SAM
Connie, it seems to me your job is to wait until Doug leaves the room and
then say,
"What Doug really meant was..." How much they pay you for that?

CONNIE
Sometimes it's my job to say it when he's in the room.

SAM
Yeah.

CONNIE
We're making a mistake not including an apology.

SAM
Is this what you mean or is this what Doug means?

CONNIE
Both.

SAM
It's not going to happen.

CONNIE
Why not?

SAM
Cause Jed Bartlet's Jed Bartlet and that's the way it goes.

CONNIE
Well, I think that's what you're saying, and it makes sense, but you know
what?

SAM
What?

CONNIE
I think you want him to apologize and not just for political reasons.

SAM
I haven't thought that much about it.

CONNIE
Sam...

SAM
There's been a lot going on and I haven't really thought that much about it.

CONNIE
You were with him when he got elected. You got him elected. You "got" him
elected.
You worked for Bartlet 18 hours a day. You never felt...

SAM
Connie, please. It's President Bartlet. Okay?

CONNIE
Yeah.

SAM
I should get back up to the hotel. (turns to leave)

CUT TO: INT: MANCHESTER HOTEL - NIGHT
Toby, Doug and Bruno sit at a table.

DOUG
We have to mention values. If we don't mention values, we're going to spend
the next
15 months trying to convince people we did mention values.

TOBY
(reading) "My `values' are New Hampshire's `values' hard work and
responsibility, strong
families and strong communities, a boundless faith in American idea of
self-reliance."
And poor people can go screw themselves.

BRUNO
Our point is, for 30 years, Democrats have been labeled "tax and spend"
as if they don't
believe in getting up everyday and going to work. That's why we have to say
it.

TOBY
Well, if that's your point, nobody's going to understand it.

DOUG
Which is exactly why I wanted to cut the three paragraphs...

TOBY
(sarcastically) Are there any problems you're interested in solving or are
you helping
us run for the Grand Marshal of the Rose Bowl Parade?!

DOUG
Look...

Toby stands up and walks into the kitchen. Bruno answers his ringing cell
phone.

BRUNO
Yeah? (beat) Okay.

CUT TO: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Toby is leaning over the counter, his shoulders hunched. Doug walks in.

DOUG
Is that something you run for?

TOBY
(turns to face him) Huh? (eats something in his hand)

DOUG
The Rose Bowl Parade. Don't you just get picked?

TOBY
I don't, uh, I don't know. (throws a pit hard into the garbage can)

DOUG
You guys are so pissed at him you don't even know it. You're more pissed at
him that
the press is. You're more pissed at him than the party is. You're so pissed
at him,
you're pissed at me. Cause if he hadn't lied, you could've run the campaign
you always
wanted to run instead of a bunch of people coming in here and teaching you
how not to
bother anybody.

Toby glares at him.

DOUG
I never drank the Kool-Aid, Toby. I came to win. And you're so pissed at
him that you
can't even admit that for the last two weeks, you've gone to sleep at night
thanking
God that I did.

TOBY
Yeah?

DOUG
Bruno just got off the phone with Leo. The speech is locked.

Doug walks away. Toby watches him, then throws another pit into the garbage.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. MANCHESTER HOTEL - DAY
Through the window, we can see several people climbing into a van parked
across from
the hotel. Inside, the ground floor of the hotel is hopping with aides and
staff making
last minute preparations for the speech. Phones are ringing. Leo is standing
next to a
table where an aide is seated. He's reading a document and talking to the
aide, while
other people, including Donna, scurry around the room and the hallway.

LEO
Whitley left in the first van. He's there already. So somebody sit with the
Boston Globe.
(looks around, sees Donna) Donna, where's Josh?

DONNA
I'll get him.

Donna goes upstairs.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
There are papers all over the table and the bed is unmade. All the lights
are on. Josh
is slouching in a wing chair with his back to the door. He's wearing gym
clothes and
eating candy. Donna knocks on the door.

JOSH
Come in.

Donna enters the room and shuts the door behind her.

DONNA
You're supposed to be downstairs.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
You're not ready yet?

JOSH
(exasperated) We're blowing this RU-486 thing.

DONNA
You got to get in the shower.

Donna hurries around the room gathering up pieces of clothing for him to
wear.
Josh just keeps talking, not moving.

JOSH
Among everything else, it's gonna look like we're kicking off the campaign
by pandering
to women's groups.

DONNA
(mildly annoyed) Josh...

JOSH
Yeah, no question about it, most voters are pro-choice, but the ones that
aren't are
gonna devote their lives and their money to beating you. "Guns don't kill
people;
Bartlet does." It's gonna look like we screwed up the timing so the press
is gonna
write about process and not about issues, and getting political reporters
to write
about issues in the first place is like getting kids to eat their vegetables.

DONNA
You got to shave.

JOSH
Don't you want to know how it's like getting kids to eat their vegetables?

DONNA
Shave and shower.

JOSH
(sighs and finally gets up) It helps if there's nothing else on their plate.

Josh shuffles toward the bathroom as Donna arranges his clothes on the bed.
He looks exhausted.

DONNA
(concerned) You couldn't sleep?

JOSH
(stops and turns to look at her) I know I could stop this thing! One phone
call!
The President's not even involved! "Could you do us a favor, could you hold
off two
weeks? We love your drug but we don't want it folded into our news cycle! He's
getting
more and more animated and distressed as he speaks. He's breathing heavily. I
could have
picked up the phone, I could have picked up the phone, I could...

DONNA
Josh...

All of a sudden he turns away from her and smacks the bathroom door frame
very hard.

JOSH
(yelling) God!

He leans against the doorframe, looking very upset.

DONNA
What's this about?

JOSH
(sighs and pauses) I blew the tobacco thing... That could have helped us,
and I was...

He looks disgusted with himself. He's still breathing heavily.

JOSH
This is gonna be a very close election.

Donna looks worried, but doesn't say anything.

JOSH
I gotta take a shower.

He turns away and shuffles toward the shower and closes the door, leaving
Donna standing
silently in the middle of his room.

CUT TO: EXT. BARTLET FAMILY FARM - DAY
C.J. drives up to the guard station near the house. A police car drives past
her in the
opposite direction. There's a black SUV pulled up on the front lawn and a
couple of
security officers milling about.

C.J.
Good morning.

GUARD
You can go on up.

C.J. drives past the house and out to the barn.

CUT TO: INT. BARN AT BARTLET FARM - DAY
Bartlet is standing at his lectern and scribbling notes on his
speech. C.J. pulls up
next to the entrance, gets out of her car, and walks into the barn. She
stands near
the door, keeping some distance. Even though he must have heard the car door
close,
he doesn't look up.

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Come in.

C.J.
I was told you wanted to see me.

BARTLET
Yeah. Don't be a marriage counselor. It pisses me off. Okay?

C.J. looks a little confused. He keeps scribbling notes on the speech,
barely meeting
her gaze.

C.J.
I'm sorry?

BARTLET
You know what I'm talking about.

C.J.
Sir... She walks toward him, stopping just a few feet away.

BARTLET
That part of my life doesn't belong to you.

C.J.
(sincerely) Sir, I was simply putting together what I thought was the best
press event.
The First Lady is an excellent speaker and...

Bartlet dismissively waves at her, still focused on the speech.

BARTLET
All right. That's all. I'll see you out there.

C.J. looks a bit dismayed and frustrated. She turns and slowly walks away,
but then stops
and turns back around to face him. He's completely focused on the speech
again.

C.J.
Sir, I think if you get a bump in the polls after today's speech, as we
expect you will,
I think it'd be a good time for me to resign.

BARTLET
(looks up) Yeah?

C.J.
(nods) Well, to leave earlier would have been strategically...

He gives her another dismissive wave and tries to go back to focusing on
the speech.

BARTLET
Yeah, okay.

C.J.
(raising her voice) Look, the press is...

BARTLET
(sternly, raising his voice) That's nonsense to me and I don't care!

C.J.
Well, you might not care...

BARTLET
(yelling, gesturing) For all the new jobs we've created, there are single
mothers
working two of them at minimum wage. There are school districts where less
than half
the students graduate. And a kid born in Harlem is more likely to go to
prison than a
four-year college! They're bringing guns to school, C.J.!

C.J.
(hurt, defiant) Don't you dare lecture me, Mr. President! Don't you dare do
it!

Bartlet stops cold, his glasses held in mid air. He looks pretty taken aback,
practically speechless. C.J. slowly turns away from him, but seems to
hesitate,
not sure if she should leave or say something else. Bartlet stares at her
for several
long moments.

BARTLET
(gently) I was never supposed to win.

C.J. turns around to look at him. He's holding his glasses and rubbing them
nervously.

BARTLET
I got in it polling in the single digits. Hoynes had it locked up. I got in
it to give
some speeches and keep him honest...

He walks toward her slowly, occasionally allowing a tiny smile to cross his
face,
trying to lighten the mood.

BARTLET
...then you guys came along and all of a sudden I got 22% in Iowa and then
South Carolina
and Michigan and... then Illinois.

C.J. looks at him with a mixture of sadness and distress.

BARTLET
(shakes his head) It was a mistake benching you for that last press
conference.

She just stares at him. Charlie knocks on one of the barn doors and they
both turn
toward the door.

CHARLIE
Excuse me. C.J., they need you.

C.J. turns back to look at Bartlet, with a pained expression on her face,
the anger gone.
He stares at her for several moments. His expression is serious and direct,
but kind.

BARTLET
(softly) I need you, too.

C.J. takes this in, the impact of his words really hitting her, and nods
slightly.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

She walks out with Charlie. Bartlet watches them go, then goes back to his
lectern.
He puts his glasses on and sighs as he begins to work on the speech again.

CUT TO: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD IN MANCHESTER - DAY
The Presidential motorcade, consisting of half a dozen vehicles and an
ambulance,
races along past farms, trees, and stone fences. Several police motorcycles,
their
sirens blaring, escort the motorcade.

CUT TO: INT. BARTLET'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Abbey are sitting in the back seat, silent, looking out the
windows.
Bartlet sighs deeply.

BARTLET
Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married
to the same
people they were married to before they went there?

ABBEY
(looks at him, puzzled) What?

BARTLET
I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.

ABBEY
(slightly amused, but concealing it) You could not have been an astronaut.

BARTLET
I'd have been a great astronaut.

ABBEY
You're afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small places.

BARTLET
I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.

ABBEY
(pauses to look at him)I know you would have.

BARTLET
(pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really
happy about
that.Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.

ABBEY
There's something important I have to say.

BARTLET
Say it.

ABBEY
I haven't really made up my mind yet... but at the moment... I'm leaning
towards
voting for you.

They look at each other for several moments, hints of smiles on their
faces. Then he
looks back out the window.

CUT TO: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
The band is playing and the crowd is cheering as Secret Service agents make
last minute
preparations onstage for the President's arrival. In a classroom off the
hallway, the
campaign staff, Doug, Bruno and Connie, are meeting with the regular staff
including
Donna, Charlie, Sam, Josh and Toby. Leo and Josh are pacing, while most of
the others
are leaning or sitting on the desks. Bruno is standing in the back of the
room.
They're arguing about the speech. As they argue, the cheering and applause
continue
outside. The introductory speeches have started.

DOUG
(reading) ..."to fall victim to torpor and timidity." "Torpor"... is not a
word a lot
of people know.

SAM
It means apathy.

TOBY
And dullness.

DOUG
I know what it means.

CONNIE
Doug means...

DOUG
They know what I mean.

C.J. walks into the room and closes the door behind her. She looks a little
tired.

C.J.
Hey.

Leo and Toby look up to acknowledge her, but they don't say anything. They
just turn
back toward Doug.

DOUG
If they don't know what the word means...

C.J.
What's the word?

JOSH
(after taking a sip of water) "Torpor."

C.J.
It means apathy.

TOBY
And dullness.

Everyone but Doug is looking more and more impatient with this conversation,
rolling
their eyes, standing up. Even Bruno looks annoyed.

DOUG
(louder, more exasperated) I know what the word means. I'm saying if people
don't know
what the word means...

Bartlet walks in briskly through a door behind Doug.

BARTLET
They can look it up!

Everyone, including Doug, stands. Bartlet stops and stands next to the
teacher's desk
at the front of the room.

EVERYONE
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our
job to raise
it. If you're going to be the "Education President," it'd be nice not to
hide that you
have an education.

Abbey's voice can barely be heard as she starts her speech. Bartlet points
at Bruno and
gestures politely to Doug to leave.

BARTLET
Bruno, would you mind?

Bruno nods. He, Doug and Connie quietly leave the room. As the door opens,
the staff
can hear a bit of Abbey speaking and the crowd applauding and cheering.

ABBEY (VO)
...of being elected Governor of his home state.

Bruno and his colleagues close the door, returning the room to relative
silence.
Bartlet sighs and casually leans against the desk. There's a portrait of
Abraham
Lincoln on the wall. Leo and Charlie are standing somberly behind him.

BARTLET
Churchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose.

Bartlet stops and pauses for several moments, like he's changing his mind
about what to
say. The staff look at him patiently and expectantly, like they're anticipating
an
inspiring lecture. He sighs, then speaks with great emotion.

BARTLET
It occurs to me, I never said "I'm sorry." (pause) I am. (pause) For the
lawyers, for the
press, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are
good. They want
to win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if
you can't do
both. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words.

Bartlet slowly stands up.

BARTLET
There's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart,
disciplined
campaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble,
nothing
that's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing
that shows
you think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby?

TOBY
No, sir.

BARTLET
It isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a
great nation.
We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today.

The staff look more determined, especially C.J. An aide opens the door
leading out to
the hallway and the podium. C.J. turns at the sound of the door opening. Once
again,
they can hear Abbey speaking.

ABBEY (VO)
And so, my friends...

AIDE
Sir?

Bartlet nods at the aide, then looks back at Leo and Charlie. They do not
waver as they
meet his gaze.

ABBEY (VO)
...it is my pleasure and my great fortune to introduce my husband, our
friend,
New Hampshire's greatest son, and the President of the United States: Josiah
Bartlet.

The crowd's cheers and applause get louder and louder as Abbey finishes her
speech.
Bartlet walks toward the door, past the staff, and buttons his jacket. Only
Charlie
follows him. The rest of the staff wait for Bartlet to leave. Just as he
reaches the
doorway, he stops and hesitates. He hears Abbey say his name. And then he
turns around
to face them.

BARTLET
You know what? Break's over.

Bartlet turns and walks out through the hallway to the podium where Abbey
is standing,
waiting for him, clapping along with the crowd. The cheers and applause have
gotten
very loud. When Bartlet reaches the podium, he kisses Abbey and then he
turns to wave
to the crowd. C.J., Josh, Sam, Toby and Leo emerge onto the podium, one by
one, and
assemble themselves behind Bartlet. They clap along with the crowd. Donna
and Charlie
hang back by the doorway, clapping.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
