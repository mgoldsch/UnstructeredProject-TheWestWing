TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet and C.J. are sitting. C.J. is obviously bored while Bartlet talks.

BARTLET
I'm not wild about Camp David.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I'm not the only one, either. Bess Truman didn't like it. I read that
somewhere.
She thought it was dull. [pause] But there I go, Thanksgiving at Camp David.

C.J.
Yeah.

BARTLET
[pause] It's not a place you go at Thanksgiving, not when you have a farm.

C.J.
Isn't Camp David a farm?

BARTLET
No.

C.J.
Oh.

BARTLET
What makes you think it's a farm?

C.J.
I don't know, it's outside...

BARTLET
Farms have things you can grow, and animals.

C.J.
Right.

BARTLET
I want you to learn more about farms.

C.J.
There's more?

BARTLET
Yeah.

C.J.
Okay. [rolls eyes]

BARTLET
Doesn't matter. Thanksgiving's where your family is, and this year my family's
at
Camp David. Why, I do not know. Abbey didn't wanna schlepp to New Hampshire.
Schlepping in a 747. It's not like we were gonna have to carry our own bags
or
anything, but I do not argue.

Pause. C.J. examines her nails.

BARTLET
Were we talking about something?

C.J.
I don't know, sir. When I came in here, back in the late '50s, there was a
purpose to it,
but then one thing led to another and I blacked out. I mean, I can hang in
there with
the best of them, sir, but somewhere during the discussion of anise and
coriander and
the other 15 spices you like to use to baste a turkey, I simply lost
consciousness.

BARTLET
[pause] You know that line you're not supposed to cross with the President?

C.J.
I'm coming up on it?

BARTLET
No-no. Look behind you.

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Would you like to leave?

C.J.
With your permission, sir.

BARTLET
Damn right, with my permission. [stands]

C.J.
Yes, sir. [stands and hurries to the door]

BARTLET
It's the brine that keeps the meat soft, lady. You soak it overnight in water,
salt, sugar...

C.J.
[opens the door, starts to exit] Seventeen kinds of--

BARTLET
Seventeen kinds of spices including?

C.J.
[sticks head back in office] Anise and coriander.

BARTLET
Now you can go.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President. [shuts door]

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
C.J. exits. Josh is sitting there.

JOSH
How you doing?

C.J.
[poses in the doorway] I'm done, baby.

JOSH
Yeah?

C.J.
[starts snapping her fingers] I set up the I Board meeting with the Post on
budget gains,
I did an early briefing on the week loot and import quarter proclamation,
reported the
turkey, went to my dentist. I'm done.

JOSH
So there are these two Indians in the lobby.

They start walking through the HALLWAY.

C.J.
Yeah?

JOSH
No, it's-it's not the beginning of a joke. I'm saying there's these two
Indians in the lobby.

C.J.
[stops snapping] And I'm saying "yeah?"

JOSH
They had a meeting scheduled this morning with Jacob Cutler at
Intergovernmental Affairs.
Cutler had to cancel the meeting so he could see northwestern border state
governors to
discuss pourous borders between the U.S. and Canada, that's the governors
of Washington,
Idaho, North Dakota, Montana and Alaska.

C.J.
Yeah?

JOSH
Yeah, well, apparently the Indians say they're not leaving until they get
satisfaction.

They stop outside the lobby doors.

C.J.
[turns to face Josh] How is this my problem?

JOSH
C.J., there's two Indians sitting in the lobby, they say they're not leaving,
there's
press everywhere. I just made it your problem.

C.J.
[pause, sighs] Indians on the day before Thanksgiving. Wow. Ironic.

She opens the doors and walks into the LOBBY.

JOSH
Yeah.

C.J. walks up to the aforementioned Indians.

C.J.
[to security guard, Harry] Harry, I got it, thanks. [turns to the Indians]
Good morning. I'm CJ Cregg.

MAGGIE MORNINGSTAR-CHARLES
I'm Maggie Morningstar-Charles, and this is our Tribal Council, Jack
Lonefeather.

C.J.
I'm sorry about your meeting, Mr. Cutler had to meet with some northwestern
governors
about an important problem.

MAGGIE
Yes.

C.J.
It'll be no problem to reschedule the appointment.

MAGGIE
Oh, we can wait.

C.J.
Would you like to step into my office and we can try to reschedule it right
now?

MAGGIE
We're fine here.

C.J.
I'm sorry?

JACK LONEFEATHER
She said we're fine here.

C.J.
[pause] Actually, you're not fine here.

JACK
Then you can forcibly remove us. [pause] I've noticed that correspondants
from the Times,
Reuters, CNN and the Miami Herald are here.

MAGGIE
And the Washington Post is on speed dial.

C.J.
This is gonna have something to do with us screwing you out of all your land,
isn't it?

MAGGIE
Yes.

C.J.
See, I was done.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Leo is walking towards Josh's office. Josh exits the office, and they walk
together.

JOSH
I was just coming to see you. Did you hear about the two Indians in the lobby?

LEO
One of them wants to become a rabbi?

JOSH
It's not a joke, they're really... Nevermind.

LEO
Last week a 13-year-old kid in Georgia shot his teacher in the back of the
head.

They walk down the HALLWAY.

JOSH
I read about that. They can't find the kid, right?

LEO
Interpol made the arrest last night in Rome.

JOSH
In Italy?

LEO
His parents... Yeah, Rome. In Italy. His parents sent him there as soon as
it happened.
The parents are in custody, obviously the governor wants him back, and Italy
won't
extradite to a country that has the death penalty. The governor wants Justice
to help.

They reach LEO'S OFFICE and enter. Leo walks around to back of his desk.

JOSH
Why isn't this conversation taking place in the DeKalb County DA's office?

LEO
It's taken on an international flavor.

JOSH
Much like myself.

LEO
Yeah. You'll talk to some people?

JOSH
Si.

LEO
And you'll stop doing that soon.

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Toby sits inside at desk reading a newspaper, Sam is pacing outside of door,
with paper in his hand.

TOBY
[looking up from newspaper] Sam? Are you guarding my office?

SAM
[chuckling] That's funny.

TOBY
Thank you.

Toby pauses, reads newspaper, looks up and sees Sam still pacing.

TOBY
Yeah?

SAM
[entering office] On Monday, the OMB is putting out a new formula for
calculating the
poverty level.

TOBY
I saw that. Doesn't it need Presidential approval before it goes to Congress?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
What's the problem?

SAM
It's a good news, bad news thing. Under the new formula, poverty is up two
percent. It was
anyone under seventeen thousand, five hundred and twenty-four before, now
it's twenty thousand.

TOBY
What does that shake out to?

SAM
Four million new poor people.

TOBY
Four million?!?

SAM
Yeah. Obviously, that's the bad news.

TOBY
Yeah...

SAM
The good news is more people will be eligible for benefits.

TOBY
And taxpayers are nuts about that. Let's get back to the bad news. Four
million people
became poor on the President's watch?

SAM
They didn't become poor. They were poor already. And now we're calling them
poor.

TOBY
What was wrong with the old formula?

SAM
I don't know.

TOBY
Find out.

SAM
It is possible that this is a statistical reality and not a political finding.

TOBY
Well, get together with somebody at OMB and find out what was wrong with
the statistical
reality of the old formula.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
And do it today.

SAM
[heading out of office] Yeah.

TOBY
It's like when they did that thing with the SAT scores and I got dumber
twenty years
after I went to college.

SAM
It's a little like that.

TOBY
Talk to somebody.

SAM
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. LOBBY - DAY
C.J. is standing talking to Maggie and Jack.

MAGGIE
The treaty of 1856-

C.J.
Yes. Listen-

MAGGIE
Moved from New York to Wisconsin.

C.J.
Listen, this isn't a good place for this. This is... a lobby.

MAGGIE
I know what this is.

C.J.
Yes.

MAGGIE
I have a degree from the University of Michigan.

JACK
Look, Ms. Cregg. If we give up this land, we loose our one bullet in our
gun. We need
to be in view of the press.

C.J.
What tribe are you from?

JACK
We're Stockbridge-Munsee Indians. Like Maggie was saying, when we were moved
to Wisconsin,
we signed the treaty of 1856. In return, the government was supposed to
protect our
reservations, provide education and health care, and we would still be a
sovereign nation.
But then the Dawes Act came.

C.J.
And you were forced to sell the land?

JACK
We went from forty-six thousand acres of tribal land to eleven thousand. The
Dawes Act
was also supposed to civilize us. Henry Dawes said that to be civilized,
you must cultivate
the land, wear civilized clothes, drive studebaker wagons, and drink whiskey.

MAGGIE
The drinking part was particularly constructive.

C.J.
Well, before we go any further, I should tell you, there's absolutely nothing
I can do for you.

MAGGIE
Imagine our shock.

C.J.
Yes.

MAGGIE
In two generations, we'll be wiped out.

On C.J., distressed--

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY
Donna is standing near her desk. Josh enters, talking to her.

JOSH
Did you get me a flight?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
Excellent. One that gets me there in time for dinner?

DONNA
Yes.

JOSH
And I don't have to change planes in Atlanta?

DONNA
No, even better. You do have to change planes in Atlanta.

JOSH
I told you that-

DONNA
You have to change planes in Atlanta, deal with it.

Donna walks around distributing paperwork, Josh follows.

JOSH
There must be something.

DONNA
There's a 6:10 to Orlando, it gets in at 9:15, but that's too late for
dinner. You could
get a C141 leaving from Andrews for Homestead, but there's a problem with
that, too.

JOSH
It would trigger a Congressional investigation?

DONNA
[beat] All right, two problems.

JOSH
Find me... something.

DONNA
Why is this being done last minute?

JOSH
And remember to scold me a couple times before I leave.

DONNA
Did you only just decide you were going home for Thanksgiving?

JOSH
No, but I thought I was going to Connecticut.

DONNA
[sitting at her desk] Why?

JOSH
'Cause that's where the house is.

DONNA
Your mom sold the house ten months ago.

JOSH
I made a mistake.

DONNA
You forgot where your mother lives?

JOSH
I'm from Connecticut, okay?! And like a swallow to Capistrano, I have
to... Just, find me
a flight, would you? And call Russell Angler at the State Department and
tell him I need
to see him about the kid in Georgia, he'll know what I'm talking about.

DONNA
I'm telling your mother you forgot where she lives.

JOSH
[entering his office] You're the girl I made fun of in elementary school,
you know that?

DONNA
[grinning] Yes, I do.

Sam enters the bullpen.

SAM
Donna, can I go in?

DONNA
You don't have any special, secret flights to Palm Beach today, do you?

SAM
Yeah, but you gotta change planes in Atlanta.

DONNA
Okay.

Sam enters JOSH'S OFFICE.

JOSH
Did you hear about this kid?

SAM
The one who shot his teacher?

JOSH
His parents, who are in custody, Fed-Exed him to Rome, which is in Italy.

SAM
You're kidding me?

JOSH
No, it's really in Italy.

Josh crosses room to mini-fridge, removes two bottles of water.

JOSH
But that's not the best part.

SAM
Italy won't extradite him.

JOSH
The best part is that Italy won't extradite him.

Josh tosses Sam a bottle of water and walks towards his desk.

SAM
Because of the death penalty in Georgia?

JOSH
They've come a long way since Mussolini.

SAM
You should mention that.

JOSH
I will.

Josh takes a large gulp of water from his bottle, and stands behind his desk.

SAM
[sitting in front of Josh's desk] So, it turns out we've got four million
new poor people.

JOSH
Since when?

SAM
Well, yesterday, actually.

JOSH
The OMB's recommending a new model?

SAM
Yes.

JOSH
Well, I'm not an expert, but wouldn't we have a better chance at getting
re-elected if we
could say there were four million fewer poor people? Hang on, wait. I am an
expert.

SAM
Well, I think we'd have a better chance at getting re-elected if there
actually were four
million fewer poor people, but I'm gonna talk to Bernice Collette anyway.

JOSH
[walking out from behind desk] You gonna try and get her not to recommend
the new model?

SAM
Well, to hold off for a while, anyway.

JOSH
[leaving office] You know Bernice?

SAM
That's why I came to you.

JOSH
[sticking his head back in the office] She's a little tough to warm up.

SAM
I'll warm her up.

They both exit to the HALLWAY.

JOSH
Yeah?

SAM
Jokes. Nicknames. That sort of thing.

JOSH
Sounds like you've got a pretty good plan.

SAM
Anything else I need to know?

JOSH
Don't go through the lobby.

SAM
Why not?

JOSH
[starting to walk away] Indians in the lobby.

SAM
[beat] Is that code?

JOSH
No. There are Indians in the lobby.

SAM
Okay.

Josh walks away. Sam goes to peer into lobby, makes a confused face, and
turns around to walk away.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet sits at desk, signing a piece of paper. Charlie stands next to him.

BARTLET
Bess Truman didn't like Camp David, either, she thought it was dull. Doesn't
matter.

Bartlet hands the paper to Charlie, putting it in a folder.

BARTLET
Long as you've got an oven, and you go to three hundred and twenty degrees. You
take your
turkey, which has been soaking overnight in water, salt, coriander...

Bartlet is interrupted by a knocking at the door, which is followed by the
door opening.

NANCY
Excuse me, sir. Toby would like to see you, should I send him in?

CHARLIE
[eager] Yes.

Bartlet shoots Charlie a dirty look. Charlie looks back at him.

CHARLIE
Yeah, well, that's obviously a question for you, sir.

BARTLET
She was asking me.

CHARLIE
I'll step out.

BARTLET
Yeah.

Charlie leaves. Toby enters.

TOBY
[walking towards desk] Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
Hey.

TOBY
Before anything else, I was hoping I could impose on you for as much
information you could
spare about making a turkey.

BARTLET
This is some sort of pre-emptive psychological thing?

TOBY
Yeah.

BARTLET
That's not going to work.

TOBY
Yeah. You're gonna see, on next week's message calendar, there's a notation
about a new
federal initiative to provide low-cost cell phones to neighborhood watch
groups.

BARTLET
I saw the message calendar. I'm having some difficulty navigating the
color-coding.

TOBY
The colors are for areas - Blue is education... Green is economy, it's a
quick glance way
to let us know if we're getting enough hits on our issues.

BARTLET
Well, there should be a separate color for things I don't care about.

TOBY
Like what?

BARTLET
Providing low-cost cell phone service to neighborhood watch groups.

TOBY
It's important.

BARTLET
Really?

TOBY
You spot a crime, you gonna go to a pay phone?

BARTLET
There's nothing wrong with the policy, it's just too small. I could fund
this initiative
out of my pocket.

TOBY
It's ten million dollars.

BARTLET
Leo could fund it out of his pocket. Shouldn't this be local government,
like the YMCA
or something?

TOBY
We have an idea, which we have reason to believe is popular, which is,
that in addition
to passing large and abstract pieces of legislation-

BARTLET
We pass minute, but easy to understand.

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How popular?

TOBY
Eighty-two percent.

BARTLET
Get out of here.

TOBY
Hand to God.

BARTLET
Bring me that polling data.

Toby gets up to leave, then turns back to Bartlet.

TOBY
What kind of stuffing are we talking about?

BARTLET
Cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts, andouille sausage.

TOBY
You gonna cook on the inside or separate?

BARTLET
Inside.

TOBY
You better make sure it cooks.

BARTLET
It'll cook.

TOBY
If it doesn't cook, people are gonna get sick.

BARTLET
It'll cook.

TOBY
They'll be very, very sick.

BARTLET
I've got it covered. Anything else?

TOBY
You know about the new OMB definitions?

BARTLET
I know they're coming out. What's it going to look like?

TOBY
Depends. You want more poor people or fewer poor people?

BARTLET
Fewer.

TOBY
You got it. Thank you, Mr. President.

Toby walks out, with a lingering look at Bartlet.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is standing in the doorway, talking to Leo, who is sitting at his
desk.

BARTLET
...carroway seeds, thyme, cornbread, oysters, water chestnuts and Handui
sausage.

LEO
Sounds good.

BARTLET
Yeah. But Toby seemed to indicate that you have to be careful if you cook
it inside the
turkey, because in some cases it doesn't cook, and when that happens, people
get sick.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
You know about this?

LEO
I've heard about it.

BARTLET
[walks into the office] 'Cause I thought Toby might be playing with me.

LEO
Maybe he is.

BARTLET
But you said you've heard of it.

LEO
Maybe I am, too.

BARTLET
Nah, you don't have that kind of wit.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I need to talk to an expert.

LEO
Talk to Rene. [yells] Margaret!

BARTLET
I can't ask Rene.

MARGARET
[enters office] Yes?

LEO
The President needs to speak with the head chef. Could you try him at home?

BARTLET
No. No, I can't. Thanks Margaret.

Margaret exits.

BARTLET
I can't ask Rene right now.

LEO
Why not?

BARTLET
Well, frankly, I thought he did something stupid and inconsiderate last week,
but it
turns out I was just in a bad mood.

LEO
You gave Rene a firm talking to?

BARTLET
Yes. And while he didn't deserve it, he will someday soon.

Charlie knocks on the door.

CHARLIE
Excuse me.

LEO
Come on in.

CHARLIE
They dropped off the polling data you were asking for.

BARTLET
82 percent are in favor of fixing potholes?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I'm gonna look at this.

LEO
Okay.

Bartlet and Charlie exit to THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
They want the nickel and dime stuff, I'll tell you one thing we can do.

CHARLIE
What's that, sir?

BARTLET
This time of the year there should be a hotline you can call with questions
about cooking
turkey. A special 800 number where the phones are staffed by experts.

CHARLIE
There is.

BARTLET
What do you mean?

CHARLIE
The Butterball hotline.

BARTLET
[pause, takes off his glasses and stares at Charlie] Butterball has a hotline?

CHARLIE
Yeah. It's an 800 number, the phones are staffed by experts.

BARTLET
Are you kidding me?

CHARLIE
No.

BARTLET
God, I'm sorry, I love my country. Charlie, get me the number for the
Butterball hotline.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Charlie turns to leave. Bartlet looks over poll data as he walks to his desk.

BARTLET
Hang on.

Charlie turns around.

BARTLET
I don't think this is the right one.

CHARLIE
[turns around] The right poll?

BARTLET
Yeah, this is something different. Hang on a second. This is-- [pause]
Son of a bitch.
[walks up to Charlie] Find Bruno Gianelli, tell him I wanna see him right
away.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. [exits]

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY
Sam meets BERNICE COLLETTE.

GINGER
Sam?

SAM
Yeah?

GINGER
Bernice Collette.

SAM
Thanks.

BERNICE
Hey Sam. [shakes hands with Sam]

SAM
How ya doing, Bernie?

BERNICE
Not wild about people calling me Bernie.

SAM
Sure. What should I call you?

BERNICE
Bernice is fine.

SAM
But how will you know I'm your buddy?

BERNICE
I'm okay living in the dark on that.

SAM
[pause] Okay.

They start walking through the halls to the office.

SAM
Can you tell me how the current standard was reached?

BERNICE
The new one?

SAM
The current one. The new one hasn't been signed off on.

BERNICE
We have to sign off on it.

They stop outside Sam's office door.

SAM
Why?

BERNICE
It's much more accurate.

SAM
Well how was the old one reached? The current one.

They enter SAM'S OFFICE.

BERNICE
In 1963, an eastern European immigrant named Mollie Orshansky, who was
working over in
social security, came up with it. Food was the most costly living expense
where she came from.

SAM
Our cost of living formula for the last 40 years has been based on life in
Poland during
the Cold War?

BERNICE
This is what I'm talking about. I mean, food doesn't account for one-third
of a family's
budget. Housing is more expensive than food. The current model also doesn't
take into
account transportation and health insurance. So let's call the current model
the old
model and sign off on the new model.

SAM
All right. Sit down.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Josh is walking with RUSSELL ANGLER.

ANGLER
The kid's being held at San Battal in Rome.

JOSH
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

ANGLER
Well he's a minor, so this is uncharted territory. Now listen, I've gotta
tell you something.

JOSH
What?

ANGLER
Unless the eligibility papers meet all the treaty obligations, they're gonna
have to release him.

JOSH
Under whose custody?

ANGLER
They're just gonna release him.

JOSH
[stops walking] Russ...

ANGLER
It's provisional arrest. We don't have the paperwork right, the foreign
minister's gonna
review it and decline extradition. They have no grounds to hold him.

JOSH
I-I don't--

ANGLER
He didn't break any Italian laws.

They start walking again.

JOSH
They're gonna give him a Eurail pass and a backpack?

ANGLER
Well, the governor's gotta guarantee that he's not gonna seek the death
penalty.

JOSH
First of all, it isn't up to the governor, it's up to the DeKalb DA. Second
of all...
this is Georgia.

ANGLER
Then we're not getting the kid back. "Extradition shall be refused unless
the requesting
party provides such assurances as the requested party considers sufficient
that the death
penalty shall not be imposed." I didn't write the U.S./Italian Extradition
Treaty.

JOSH
This kid shoots his teacher in the head and gets life in Venice, we're all
gonna look
like idiots. I gotta put this out before it's in the papers.

ANGLER
Yeah.

JOSH
What do I do now?

ANGLER
I'd talk to the head of affairs at the Italian embassy.

JOSH
I wanna do it today.

ANGLER
I'll set it up.

JOSH
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - DAY
C.J. is still speaking with the Indians in the middle of the lobby.

JACK
...we had swamp land, our soil too rocky to farm, so we had to foreclose or
sell it at
three cents an acre.

MAGGIE
In 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act allowed us to start buying back the
land, bad and good.

C.J.
And why would you want to buy back the bad land, too?

MAGGIE
Because the IR Act said that if we put it in a trust, like a national park,
it would
never be taken away.

C.J.
So, what you need is, what?

JACK
An answer on our CFR 151 application.

C.J.
I'm sure that's handled by the Department of the Interior.

JACK
It is.

C.J.
And?

JACK
We're still waiting for an answer.

C.J.
These things take a little bit of time.

MAGGIE
We've been waiting for a little bit of time.

C.J.
It's a big interior, Maggie.

MAGGIE
We've been waiting for 15 years, CJ.

C.J.
[pause] 15 years?

MAGGIE
Yeah. So you can see why we don't mind hanging around here for a little while.

C.J.
Yeah.

A reporter, Mark, interrupts.

MARK
C.J.?

C.J.
[walks over to Mark] Yeah?

MARK
Are you guys gonna have anything on Macedonia before the end of the day?

C.J.
I don't think so.

MARK
Okay. What's going on?

C.J.
I'm just talking to my friends.

MARK
Okay.

C.J.
Have a good weekend, Mark. Have a good Thanksgiving.

MARK
I'm Canadian.

C.J.
Yours is in April?

MARK
October.

C.J.
Oh. To have it be over.

MARK
Yeah.

He leaves. C.J. turns around and looks at the Indians.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. THE ITALIAN EMBASSY - DAY

FEDRIGOTTI
I have to ask you, because I'm asking everyone: there's an American children's
book I'm
trying to find and having difficulty. It's called "The Little Red Lighthouse
and the
Great Grey Bridge."

JOSH
I know "The Little Red Lighthouse." That's a great book.

FEDRIGOTTI
Look, the funiculaire - it's not a funiculaire. It's a...

JOSH
The George Washington bridge.

FEDRIGOTTI
Yes. You know the lighthouse is still there. It's very hard to see. If you're
driving up
the Riverside, the West Side Highway goes...

JOSH
Yeah, you peer down just at the right moment, you can see the top of it.

FEDRIGOTTI
I can't find the book, and I have a four-year-old boy now.

JOSH
I'll ask around.

FEDRIGOTTI
Thank you. Please. [Both sit.]

JOSH
Now...

FEDRIGOTTI
You stand hand in hand with no other country on this except Somalia, you
know that
don't you? Even China doesn't allow children to be executed.

JOSH
Well... Federal Law doesn't allow it, but people in the state of Georgia do,
so there's
not much... A waiter brings by a tray of coffee and food.

FEDRIGOTTI
Yes. Grazzi.

WAITER
Prego. [leaves]

JOSH
Mr. Fedrigotti...

FEDRIGOTTI
Alberto.

JOSH
Alberto... please. You'll have the ambassador speak to the foreign minister
and send the kid back?

FEDRIGOTTI
Josh, you're in a restaurant...

JOSH
Alberto...

FEDRIGOTTI
And there's a little girl who is really misbehaving. She runs around, she's
throwing food.
The father decides to punish her right there by cracking the wine bottle
over her head,
throwing her to the ground, and kicking her repeatedly. You sit at the next
table. What do you do?

JOSH
The kid wasn't throwing food.

FEDRIGOTTI
Is there a crime that girl could commit, that would have justified what the
father did?

JOSH
[laughs] See, it's... it's p[problematic when other people make my argument
for me.

FEDRIGOTTI
Yeah. And if the father said, 'This is my child, and I will punish her any
way I choose,'
would you come to the conclusion that this father has lost all perspective,
and all judgement,
and should be removed from equation?

JOSH
Okay. I'm gonna... I'll ask around about the book.

FEDRIGOTTI
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT: C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J.'s walking into her office as Carol is leaving it.

C.J.
[paces in the office, then comes to the door] What about the assistant
secretary for Indian affairs?

CAROL
He's away.

C.J.
You tried?

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J. goes back into her office, then comes out.

C.J.
Deputy Director of Intergovernmental affairs?

CAROL
He's left.

C.J.
Deputy of Acquisition... isn't there a deputy of Acquisition and Property
Management?

CAROL
Yeah, and there's also a Deputy of Travel Services.

C.J.
But?

CAROL
It's Thanksgiving. Nobody's here.

C.J.
I'm here! They're here! You're here!

CAROL
God knows that.

C.J. walks back into her office, then runs out again.

C.J.
Tell Leo's office I'm coming over. [leaves]

CUT TO: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
Bernice is sitting by Sam's desk, while Sam is outside with Toby.

SAM
She's making a certain amount of sense.

TOBY
Isn't this one of those things that can be argued from all sides?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
And one way or another, they're all right?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
You can put the numbers together a lot of different ways?

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Okay, well, let's put them together in a way that there's just fewer poor
people.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Or, if we have to go with the new formula, delay as long as we can - we have
to test it.

SAM
All right.

Ginger brings by some papers. Toby leaves, Sam steps back into his office.

SAM
So three statisticians go deer-hunting. The first one misses ten feet to
the left,
the second one misses ten feet to the right. The third one jumps up and down
and says,
'I hit it!' You got to like a guy who comes up with a statistical analysis
joke.
[goes to his desk] Certainly you would if you had let me call you Bernie.

BERNICE
Sam...

SAM
Shouldn't we test the math before the President signs it off? Create a pilot
program and
experiment for two years?

BERNICE
Test the math?

SAM
Yeah.

BERNICE
You think we did this with an abacus?

SAM
You know I've always wanted to learn how to work an abacus, 'cause on the
first day when
the check comes and you pull that thing out of your pocket and start adding
up the tip?

BERNICE
Well that and your statistics jokes will have you blazing the path through
the capital women.

SAM
Yeah. You know, the new formula doesn't take into account regional differences
in housing costs.

BERNICE
No.

SAM
You don't think it's worth it?

BERNICE
We took the national mean.

SAM
How do you suppose the landlords in New York and L.A. feel about the national
mean?

BERNICE
We debated that, but agreed it was too difficult to assess when the costs
change from year to year.

SAM
[sits down] So you drop the problem when the math gets tough.

BERNICE
Look...

SAM
You know who wouldn't be very pleased by that? Ms. Holly Orshansky of Poland,
author of the
original formula, who I think is long overdue for recognition.

BERNICE
Molly.

SAM
Hmmm?

BERNICE
Molly Orshansky?

SAM
Not Holly?

BERNICE
No.

SAM
Thought it was Holly.

Charlie walks in as Bartlet is sitting at his desk.

CHARLIE
Bruno?

BARTLET
Get him in here.

Bruno Gianelli walks in.

BARTLET
What the hell is this? [waves the poll in his hand]

BRUNO
Sorry?

BARTLET
What is this?

BRUNO
I don't know what you're waving.

BARTLET
[gets up and walks over to Bruno] It's a poll. I asked to see a poll about
certain...
doesn't matter. Then send up the wrong poll. This one asks voters where I
should spend
Thanksgiving.

BRUNO
Yeah.

BARTLET
What the hell are you doing polling where I should spend Thanksgiving?

BRUNO
Well, New England doesn't get us anything that we don't already have, and
there was a
sense it could be seen as political, with New Hampshire, the first primary
state.

BARTLET
I have Thanksgiving with my family.

BRUNO
Yeah, yeah. People like that.

BARTLET
Thank god!

BRUNO
Mr. President...

BARTLET
You politicize family to make sure they don't look political.

BRUNO
Don't get me started on ironies.

BARTLET
My family is off limits. [throws the poll on the couch and walks to his desk]

BRUNO
Sir... your candor about a terrible illness was off limits. [Bartlet turns
to look at him.]
Your regimen of self-medication was off limits. Due respect, you've used up
your off limits.

BARTLET
I'll decide when I've used them up. You don't poll where my family goes,
am I making myself clear?

BRUNO
Mh-huhmm... Sometimes I have a difficulty talking to people who don't race
sailboats.

BARTLET
What?

BRUNO
[comes closer] I have difficulty sometimes talking to people who don't race
sailboats.
When I was a teenager, I crewed Larchmont to Nassau on a 58-foot sloop called
Cantice.
There was a little piece of kelp that was stuck to the hull, and even though
it was little,
you don't want anything stuck to the hull. So, I take a boat hook on a pole
and I stick it
in the water and I try to get the kelp off, when seven guys start screaming
at me, right?
'Cause now the pole is causing more drag than the kelp was. See, what you
gotta do is you
gotta drop it in and let the water lift it out in a windmill motion. Drop
it in, and let
the water take it by the kelp and lift it out. In, and out. In, and out,
till you got it.
[beat] The voters aren't choosing a plumber, Mr. President. They are choosing
a president.
And if you don't think that your family should matter, my suggestion to you
is to get out
of professional politics. And if you think that I'm going to miss even one
opportunity to
pick up half-a-mile boat speed, you're absolutely out of your mind. When it
costs us
nothing, when we give up nothing?! You're out of your mind.

Knock on the door. Charlie comes in with some papers.

CHARLIE
Excuse me. [hands paper over to Bartlet and leaves]

BARTLET
Ah, something important!

BRUNO
What is that, sir?

BARTLET
The number for the Butterball Hotline. [starts dialing] Watch, and learn.

WOMAN [on speaker]
Welcome to the Butterball Hotline!

BARTLET
Hello...

WOMAN [on speaker]
Stand by for our next available operator to assist you.

Bartlet looks at Bruno, who looks back quietly.

C.J. is standing in front of Leo, who stands behind his desk.

C.J.
Fifteen years!

LEO
I agree. That's a long time.

C.J.
That's a pretty long time.

LEO
Yes.

C.J.
[walks round the desk] And you know all we're talking about is a sewage
plant and a
house center. They're not asking for the Great Plains.

LEO
I'll have somebody call somebody and find out what the delay is.

C.J.
What can I tell them in the meantime?

LEO
Tell them that.

C.J.
It'd be nice if they could see someone before he left. They had an
appointment.

LEO
Sealy?

C.J.
He's gone.

LEO
Do it Monday.

C.J.
We do it Monday, they're gonna stay here till Monday. Absent being dragged
off in handcuffs,
of this I'm sure. Plus right is right.

LEO
What do you want from me?

C.J.
Five minutes!

LEO
No.

C.J.
They walk out of here, they've met with the Chief of Staff.

LEO
No.

C.J.
Why not?

LEO
'Cause I'm not taking a meeting which somebody who stages a sitting in a

Bartlet opens the door to Toby, waiting outside.

BARTLET
Toby!

TOBY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Come in, please.

Toby walks in.

BARTLET
You polled where I should have Thanksgiving?

TOBY
Yeah, I saw that question.

BARTLET
And it was okay with you?

TOBY
Uh, yes sir.

BARTLET
Why?

TOBY
Because it was okay with Joey Lucas.

BARTLET
You think people should care where I have Thanksgiving?

TOBY
I know I don't give a damn...

BARTLET
All right. Doesn't matter. I straightened it out. It has a lot to do with
kelp.

TOBY
What?

WOMAN
[on speaker] Hello, welcome to the Butterball Hotline.

Bartlet runs to the phone.

TOBY
What the hell is...

BARTLET
Shhhh. Hello!!

WOMAN
[on speaker] How can I help you, sir?

BARTLET
Well, first let me say, I think this is a wonderful service you provide.

Toby comes closer.

WOMAN
Well, thank you. May I have your name please?

BARTLET
I'm a citizen.

WOMAN
I'm sure you are, sir, but if I have your name I can put your comment in
our customer feedback form.

BARTLET
[sighs] I'm Joe Betherson...sen. That's one 't', and with an 'h' in there.

WOMAN
And your address?

BARTLET
Fargo.

WOMAN
Your street address, please?

Bartlet looks at Toby desperately.

TOBY
[picks up another phone, into it] Zip code, Fargo, North Dakota, right
now. [hangs up]

BARTLET
[with evident strain] My street address is 114... 54 Pruder Street, and it's
very important
that you put 'street' down there because sometimes it gets confused with
Pruder Way and
Pruder Lane. Apartment 23 R... Fargo, North Dakota...

Charlie walks in with a piece of paper, Bartlet grabs it.

BARTLET
Zip code 50504.

WOMAN
Thank you. Your voice sounds very familiar to me.

BARTLET
I do radio commercials for... products.

WOMAN
And how can I help you?

BARTLET
[sits down] Stuffing should be stuffed inside the turkey, am I correct?

WOMAN
It can also be baked in the casserole dish.

BARTLET
Well, then we'd have to call it something else, wouldn't we?Toby sits down
and puts his
hand under his chin.

WOMAN
I suppose.

BARTLET
If I cook it inside the turkey, is there a chance I could kill my guests? I'm
not saying
that's necessarily a deal-breaker.

WOMAN
Well, there are some concerns. Two main bacterial problems are salmonella
and camplyobacter jejuna.

BARTLET
All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up,
and second of all,
how do I avoid it?

Toby and Charlie smile.

WOMAN
Make sure all the ingredients are cooked first. SautE any vegetables, fried
sausage, oysters, etc.

BARTLET
Excellent! Let's talk temperature.

WOMAN
One hundred and sixty-five degrees.

BARTLET
No, see, I was testing you! The USDA calls for turkeys to be cooked to an
internal temperature
of 180 to 185 degrees.

WOMAN
Yes, sir, I was talking about the stuffing which you want to cook to 165 to
avoid health risks.

BARTLET
Okay. Good testing!

WOMAN
Do you have an accurate thermometer?

BARTLET
Oh yeah. It was presented to me as a gift from the personal sous chef to
the king of...
[Toby raises his hand.] auto sales in...

TOBY
[whispering] Fargo.

BARTLET
Fargo. Phil Baharnd. The man can sell a car like... well, like anything.

WOMAN
Very good, sir. You have a good Thanksgiving!

BARTLET
And you do, too. Thanks a lot! [hangs up the phone, stands up] That was
excellent!
We should do that once a week.

TOBY
[stands up] Phil Baharnd?

BARTLET
I gotta get better at the names.

CHARLIE
Well, that's it, sir. You want to start the weekend?

BARTLET
No. One more thing left. Today, we find the traitor in my family. I know
the First Lady
doesn't like to schlep, but would you please tell her to meet me in the
residence?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet nods and walks outside to the portico.

Josh and Leo are sitting at Leo's desk.

JOSH
Look--

LEO
Wait--

JOSH
I need to ask you something.

LEO
What?

JOSH
What am I missing? Why does the White House care so much about an issue
involving a
local DA which, at best, should be handled by Justice and State and the
Embassy?

LEO
Because.

JOSH
Because what?

LEO
I don't want this President to get a call from the Bishop of Rome.

JOSH
Why do we care about the Bishop of Rome?

LEO
Because that's not the only name he goes by.

JOSH
[pause] What's another name?

LEO
Your Holiness?

JOSH
The Bishop of Rome is the Pope?

LEO
It'll take it to a whole new level. We don't wanna be on that level.

JOSH
No, we do not.

LEO
Forget the Italians... I wanna work it from our side.

JOSH
That means getting the DA to guarantee he won't seek the death penalty.

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
How?

LEO
DeKalb's the Georgia 4th.

JOSH
Yeah?

LEO
When Gire was elected fom the Georgia 4th election before last, Farragut
was who he beat.

JOSH
Who's Farragut?

LEO
The DeKalb DA.

JOSH
[pause] Well, I suppose there's a time for scrouples and a time for, you know.

LEO
Not.

JOSH
Yeah.

LEO
He's left the office. But he'll be on the 8 p.m. U.S. Airways out of Hartsfield

Hartsfield?

Listen--

DONNA
I got you on standby on a direct flight to Boca, where you can rent a car
and th--

JOSH
Cancel it.

DONNA
Why?

JOSH
I need a layover in Atlanta.

DONNA
[sighs] Of course you do.

She begins to walk through the doors on her right, but Josh puts a hand on
her waist
and steers her in his direction.

JOSH
And I need to get there about an hour before an 8:00 flight would take off.

DONNA
That would be around seven?

JOSH
[pause] I hadn't done the math. I'm also gonna need some information on the
DeKalb
County DA, whose name is Farragut. Do me a favor, start with a recent
photograph.
And call my mother and tell her I'm gonna be late.

DONNA
Josh?

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
You call your mother.

JOSH
Right.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT
Toby is packing up his things while Sam is again pacing outside the doorway.

TOBY
I should be able to at least fire paintballs at you while you do that.

SAM
[pause, stops pacing] It's harder to get elected if you feature the
underclass.
It's harder to help them if you hide them.

TOBY
Well what if we just recaliberate it to me everyone over 20,000 rich and
everyone
under 20,000 middle class?

SAM
Then they'd all vote Republican, wouldn't they?

TOBY
[picks up his jacket] Yeah.

SAM
I think when we get back from the weekend we should talk to Bruno.

TOBY
Why Bruno? [walks out]

SAM
Because I think if it's anything short of a torpedo in the side of the
campaign, we should
take it to Leo. I think even if it's torpedoing into the side of the campaign
we should
do it,  but that's me, and I don't imagine I'd rally much support around that.

TOBY
No.

SAM
So we'll take it to Bruno.

TOBY
Yeah.

SAM
Thanks.

TOBY
[turns to leave] See you Monday.

SAM
Have a good Thanksgiving.

Listen.

What?

CAROL
Security's nervous.

C.J.
About what?

CAROL
The Indians in the lobby.

C.J.
No, about what? It's a lawyer and a Michigan wolverine. I think we can take
them.
We always do. [aimlessly throws a pencil across the room]

CAROL
Yeah, I'm just saying, security's gonna do their thing.

C.J.

Bruno is walking out. Toby catches up to him.

TOBY
Bruno.

BRUNO
Hey.

They begin walking together.

TOBY
You get hauled in?

BRUNO
Yep.

TOBY
And?

BRUNO
We had a conversation.

TOBY
[chuckles] Listen, the OMB's gonna come out with a recommendation for a new
way to
calculate the poverty level.

BRUNO
Show of hands?

TOBY
No. But the formula raises the poverty level 2,000 in change.

BRUNO
So what is it now?

TOBY
20,000 a year. The problem is we're without a campaign and with 4 million
new poor people.

BRUNO
That's the problem?

TOBY
Yeah.

BRUNO
Not that someone making 21,000 a year is considered comfortable?

TOBY
[looks at Bruno] We're working on that one, too.

BRUNO
You keep working on that, also the other thing.

TOBY
How?

BRUNO
The same way P.T. Barnum sold a truckload of white salmon.

They stop walking and face each other.

BRUNO
By sticking labels on them that said "Guaranteed not to go pink in the
can." I have this
fish thing going on today.

TOBY
What the hell are you--

BRUNO
Are you telling me this formula has been broken for years and the other guys
haven't
fixed it? [pause] Like that. Wanna get a quick drink?

TOBY
[turns to walk away] No, I've got neices and nephews and... we'll meet Monday
on this, okay?

BRUNO
A truckload of white salmon...have you ever even heard of white salmon?

TOBY
No. [walks away]

BRUNO
I could sell anything. [walks away]

Josh walks from the escalator to a bar where MARK FARRAGUT is seated. Josh
stands at the bar
and a waiter comes over.

WAITER
Yes?

JOSH
Could I get a ginger ale, please?

He puts his bags down and turns to Farragut.

JOSH
Excuse me, you're Mark Farragut, right? I'm Josh Lyman.

FARRAGUT
Yeah. Good to meet you. [They shake hands.] You know, it's funny, I just
got a message
from my office to call.

JOSH
Yeah.

FARRAGUT
Oh God, you didn't come all the way down here just to--

JOSH
No, my mom lives in Florida. [sits] But just technically.

FARRAGUT
Sorry?

JOSH
Doesn't matter.

FARRAGUT
[sighs] The governor--

JOSH
The Italians aren't worried about the governor, Mark. They're worried about
you.

FARRAGUT
Italy can't tell me how to prosecute my case. And, no offense, Josh, but
neither can you.

JOSH
You don't have a defendant.

FARRAGUT
You can't ask me to weaken my stance.

JOSH
I know. 'Cause the Georgia 4th is tough enough for a Democrat without
appearing as
if he's against the death penalty.

FARRAGUT
I'm not against the death penalty.

JOSH
I said appearing. The only way to combat that is with TV time. You are
planning on
running again, right?

FARRAGUT
Apparently you don't know much about my last campaign.

JOSH
You raised $232,000 in four months, but then the well dried up after you
prosecuted a
corporate polluter and got stuck as anti-business. You were left with 41,500
for the
last two months and that was the ball game.

They stare at each other. A voice comes through the airport announcing the
boarding of
a flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth.

FARRAGUT
[looks up to the ceiling towards the voice] That's my flight.

JOSH
[reaches into jacket and pulls out an envelope, then places the envelope on
the bar top]
Guarantee you won't seek the death penalty, and you'll have endless media
to explain it
to your district.

FARRAGUT
Josh, please don't tell me there's any money in that envelope.

JOSH
Well, in a manner of speaking.

FARRAGUT
Names.

JOSH
Yeah, three of them. None of them local. Do it, I'm telling ya, and all
three of them
will take your call.

FARRAGUT
I can win this time.

JOSH
Flight's boarding.

FARRAGUT
[shakes hands with Josh] Have a good Thanksgiving.

JOSH
You, too.

Farragut rises, takes the envelope from the bar top, and leaves. The waiter
comes back
with Josh's ginger ale.

WAITER
Ginger ale.

JOSH
Thank you.

He picks up the glass and drinks.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bartlet is lying on a couch, reading a book. The door opens and Abbey,
who is in a wheelchair,
is wheeled in by a Secret Service member, Hal. Her leg is in a cast.

ABBEY
Hello.

BARTLET
Hi.

ABBEY
Thank you, Hal.

Hal stops her by a chair, then leaves.

ABBEY
You summoned me?

BARTLET
Yeah, sorry about that. Listen, I'm sorry about this, too, but we have to
change plans.

ABBEY
What do you mean?

BARTLET
We're gonna have dinner here at the White House. Charlie's calling everybody.

ABBEY
Why?

BARTLET
[removes his glasses] I've seen some polling information. The numbers are
staggering.
The people are looking for steadiness. For a father figure. They like it
when I'm here.
[puts glasses back on]

ABBEY
You can't be a father figure at Camp David?

BARTLET
I guess not.

ABBEY
This is ridiculous. You can't change plans on people at the eleventh hour.

BARTLET
It's no problem.

ABBEY
Of course it's a problem. When you're in the White House, there's an entire
staff that
has to be here. Now they can't go home.

BARTLET
It's their job.

ABBEY
It's Thanksgiving!

BARTLET
I've got polling numbers.

ABBEY
Which say Camp David is fine.

BARTLET
[snaps book close and removes glasses, pointing them towards Abbey]
J'accuse! [stands]

ABBEY
[puts her hand to her forehead] Oh, brother.

BARTLET
J'accuse, mon petite fromage!

ABBEY
You speak four languages. How come none of them is French?

BARTLET
Nothing's wrong with my French.

ABBEY
You just called me your little cheese.

BARTLET
[pause] That's right!

ABBEY
They came to me. They said, "What do you think about having Thanksgiving at
Camp David
instead of New Hampshire?" They told me why, I said fine.

BARTLET
And what part are you leaving out now?

ABBEY
The part where I lied to you.

BARTLET
Yes!

ABBEY
Yes! I do that sometimes. Sometimes I don't wanna go fifteen rounds on Bess
Truman and what
constitutes a farm. On your behalf, I have responded to polling information
telling me what
I should wear, and what I should say, to say nothing of the fact that I have
been subpoenaed
to answer questions before Congress on how I secretly kept you alive. So
explain to me now
how what I did was out of line.

BARTLET
[puts his hands in his pockets] You know what? It was.

ABBEY
[pause] I know.

Bartlet walks over to the chair Abbey is seated next to and sits down.

BARTLET
Well, with the ingredients for stuffing, you have to cook them before you
put them in the
turkey, and you're not gonna know whether I did or not.

ABBEY
I'll do what I always do with anything you cook. I'll wait for the girls to
eat it first.

BARTLET
Me, too.

C.J.
How many treaties have we signed with the Munsee Indians?

MAGGIE
Six.

C.J.
How many have we revoked?

MAGGIE
Six.

C.J.
What were the Munsees doing in 1778?

MAGGIE
Fighting in George Washington's army.

C.J.
And why aren't you in New York anymore?

MAGGIE
Because he marched us to Wisconsin.

C.J.
And whose land was it in the first place.

MAGGIE
[pause] Ours.

C.J.
[pause] I'm gonna have the park police escort you from the building, it'll
take me a
few minutes, so you can make whatever calls you need to make. Or, you can
come back to
my office right now, we'll make an appointment for Monday and the White
House will cover
your expenses.

A pause. C.J. looks back and forth between them both as they silently make
their decision.

JACK
Okay.

C.J.
Okay... what?

JACK
Okay, ma'am.

C.J.
[pause] No, okay or...

MAGGIE
We'll come back to the office.

C.J.
[begins to lead them back, then stops] How do you keep fighting these smaller
injustices
when they're all from the Mother of Injustices?

MAGGIE
What's the alternative?

Pause. C.J. turns and leads them back to her office.
