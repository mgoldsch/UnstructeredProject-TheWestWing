TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
The reporters laugh and chat as C.J. holds a briefing.

C.J.
We're leaving exactly one hour later than we planned. At 5:00, he'll board
Marine One for
the trip to Andrews, where he'll board Air Force One for the trip to New
York. We're just
trying to be helpful because we understand that a Presidential motorcade
rolling through
midtown Manhattan around 6:00, 6:30 really helps keep things well-lubed out
there. As a
matter of fact, we apologize to New Yorkers for the inconvenience, but the
delay was
inevitable.

The reporters chuckle.

C.J.
I meant to say 'unavoidable.' The delay was unavoidable. The President will
make a short
visit at City Hall and be in his feet at 7:30.

ARTHUR
Why is this such an early curtain?

C.J.
The play is 19 hours long.

The reporters laugh.

C.J.
It's long. It's five and a half hours.

KATIE
Do you have a nose count yet this morning?

C.J.
On the welfare bill?

KATIE
Yeah. I heard there was more movement last night.

C.J.
Yeah, there's movement. It's close.

KATIE
How close?

C.J.
Look at the color of Josh Lyman's hair.

STEVE
How much of at least the summer plan for the campaign depends on winning
the vote?

C.J.
I'd go beyond that. I'd say the future of the entire world depends on it.

More laughter.

C.J.
I don't want to scare anybody, but I'd call your Congressman. Mark?

MARK
Seriously, 50 dollars if you give me a straight answer. Are they gonna meet
tonight?

C.J.
The President and Governor Ritchie?

MARK
Yes.

C.J.
I don't know.

MARK
Now, I'm just gonna blow it on booze and women.

More laughter.

C.J.
Anything else? I'll see you in New York.

CHRIS
Uh, wait. You never told us why the delay.

C.J.
I'm sorry?

CHRIS
Why is the President leaving an hour later?

C.J.
He scheduled a last-minute meeting.

CHRIS
With who?

C.J.
Good question.

C.J. flips through her copy of the President's schedule, runs her index
finger on the
second page until she sees the name.

C.J.
Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Leo, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and intelligence personnel are already
settled inside,
waiting on the President.

LEO
Where'd we get the wires crossed? How'd the Pentagon put it on the schedule?

FITZWALLACE
We didn't get the wires crossed.

LEO
He's meeting with the guy. He's gonna be in the Oval Office.

FITZWALLACE
He was always gonna do that.

LEO
It wasn't cancelled?

FITZWALLACE
No way.

LEO
Fitz...

FITZWALLACE
The White House cancels a meeting at the last minute, he's gonna have somebody
tasting
his food for a month. I don't want him thinking.

LEO
I don't want the President... All right. I was gonna say I don't want him
putting a voice
to the guy. I take my daughter to a seafood place, the first thing she does
is name all
the lobsters in the tank, so I can't eat them.

The doors fly open for Bartlet, and everyone stands.

OFFICER
Ten-hut.

BARTLET
Hello.

LEO
Good morning, sir.

Everyone else greets the President before they all sit.

MAN
Mr. President, we wanted to lay out some of the rules.

BARTLET
There are rules for these things?

MAN
[pause] Uh, yes sir. The first one being the National Security Act, which
says basically
that only the President can trigger a covert action. This isn't a situation
where you
need to know as little as possible. The law requires that you know everything.

BARTLET
Doesn't the law also require that I not assassinate someone?

MAN 2
Yes. Political assassination is banned by Executive Order. Two Executive
Orders, as a
matter of fact.

BARTLET
I know. One of them was mine.

LEO
The E.O. is law, but it was made up by the Executive, and the Executive can
ignore it.

BARTLET
Assume for a second I say yes. How do we do it? Fitz walks up to him with
a gun?

FITZWALLACE
No, it can't be military.

BARTLET
Why?

FITZWALLACE
The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits the military from civilian law
enforcement, and
it can't happen on American soil.

BARTLET
The things we choose to care about.

MAN 3
Mr. President, I should mention that if you give the order, the law insists
that you
inform what we call the gang of eight. That's the leadership on both parties
and both
houses and the chairpeople and ranking members of the two intelligence
committees.

BARTLET
If it can't happen here, then why'd we care that Shareef was delivering
himself?

Fitzwallace has already walked next to the computer display.

FITZWALLACE
He's flying back tonight in his gulfstream. The pilot will be one of our
people. They'll
experience a mechanical failure about 90 minutes into the flight and set
down in a remote
RAF strip in Bermuda. It's really not much more than a road in the grass.

BARTLET
The British say yes?

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How many over there know about this?

FITZWALLACE
Three.

BARTLET
And some people in Bermuda?

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

LEO
[to everyone] This is as big as the club gets, all right?

BARTLET
[uneasily] Okay. Well... surely, this is the most absurd meeting I ever sat
in, and
friends, that is saying something.

As Bartlet rises, everyone else does.

MAN 3
Sir, will you be exchanging gifts with Shareef when you meet this afternoon?

BARTLET
Yeah, I imagine.

MAN 3
We'd like you to give him this.

He nods to the man next to him. The man walks over to Bartlet while pulling
out a pen
from his jacket pocket. He hands the pen to the President.

BARTLET
What does the pen do? Squirts poison?

MAN 3
It's got a small recording device in there. He'll probably throw it in the
trash, but you
never know. You might get lucky. He sticks it in his pocket on the flight
home.

From him, Bartlet looks down at the pen on his hand. He glances at Leo and
drops the pen
on the table. He starts to walk out.

MAN 3
Sir?

BARTLET
We give him it boxed. Tell them to put it in a box.

Bartlet walks out.

CUT TO: INT. TULLY'S BREAKFAST PLACE - DAY
Josh and Amy are giving their orders to the waitress.

AMY
Can I get an egg-white omelet and some toast that's badly burnt?

JOSH
Just coffee, thanks.

WAITRESS
Yes.

The waitress leaves. Josh turns to Amy.

JOSH
That doesn't give you cancer?

AMY
Burnt toast?

JOSH
Yeah.

AMY
They're not sure. That's why I have the egg-white omelet.

JOSH
Welfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters. They use it as
a barometer to
measure a President's values on work and responsibility.

AMY
Yeah.

JOSH
We're gonna win the vote.

AMY
We'll see.

JOSH
We will... but we're gonna. I have a nine-point margin.

AMY
I think you're gonna lose Burnet, Bristol and Keith.

JOSH
They're on that fence?

AMY
Yeah.

JOSH
You understand we have to authorize welfare one way or another. You got to
do it every
six years.

AMY
Have I done something to make you think I'm dumb?

JOSH
Amy...

AMY
Doesn't the fact that you have to re-authorize it means that Republicans...?

JOSH
You have an extra billion in child care.

AMY
That's great, but the marriage incentives are terrible.

JOSH
We don't like the marriage incentives, either. Don't be ridiculous, but
independent
voters...

AMY
Please say "white men" instead of "independent voters," and if you're serious
about
making welfare a second chance and not a way of life, then you have to give
people job
training.

JOSH
Call off the hunt, and I'll see to it that you guys can make up with The
White House.

AMY
Why?

JOSH
'Cause we're gonna win.

CUT TO: INT. A QUIET HOME - DAY
Charlie rings the doorbell. Nobody answers. He peeks in the side window and
knocks on the
door. A woman opens the door slightly and looks at Charlie.

MS. DEBORAH FIDERER
Yes?

CHARLIE
Mrs. DiLaguardia?

MS. FIDERER
Yes?

CHARLIE
It's Charlie. I think there's trouble with your phone line. We kept getting
disconnected.

MS. FIDERER
No...

CHARLIE
I hope you don't mind I just drove on out.

MS. FIDERER
No. Yes, I... We weren't getting disconnected. I was hanging up.

CHARLIE
Why?

MS. FIDERER
I wasn't interested in the job.

CHARLIE
Why didn't you just say so?

MS. FIDERER
You would have asked why.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

MS. FIDERER
My way was faster.

CHARLIE
Why aren't you interested...?

She slams the door before Charlie could finish. Charlie knocks again. She
opens the door.

MS. FIDERER
So you have my address. What other corners of my personal life have you
rooted out?

CHARLIE
You worked at The White House. We know where you live.

MS. FIDERER
I bet you do.

CHARLIE
May I come inside for one minute?

MS. FIDERER
You're not allowed to park there.

CHARLIE
Yes, I am.

MS. FIDERER
All right.

She finally lets Charlie inside. They walk to the living room.

CHARLIE
Mrs. DiLaguardia.

MS. FIDERER
I'm not married to Mr. DiLaguardia anymore. My name is Debbie Fiderer.

CHARLIE
Fidler?

MS. FIDERER
Fiderer.

CHARLIE
Ms. Fiderer, you've worked as executive assistant to Terrance Hunt: managing
editor of
Gannet News, Jack Kent Cooke: former owner of the Washington Redskins,
Jordan Williams:
founding partner at Cutler, Williams, Rossi, and the White House Office of
Presidential
Personnel, and I'd like you to come meet with the President today to discuss
filling
Delores Landingham's job.

MS. FIDERER
No.

CHARLIE
Why?

MS. FIDERER
Oh, this is so much worse than the phone call would have been.

CHARLIE
Why?

MS. FIDERER
Because I don't work for anyone, Charlie. I'm my own boss. I set my sail
and go that
particular direction. [points]

CHARLIE
You do?

MS. FIDERER
Yes.

CHARLIE
How's the sailing been?

MS. FIDERER
I beg your pardon?

CHARLIE
How's business?

MS. FIDERER
I'll admit I got off to a rocky start.

CHARLIE
What'd you try?

MS. FIDERER
Gambling.

CHARLIE
Didn't work out?

MS. FIDERER
No, but all that's changed.

CHARLIE
'Cause now you're...?

MS. FIDERER
I'm an alpaca farmer.

CHARLIE
Are you serious?

MS. FIDERER
It's the world's finest livestock investment, Charlie.

CHARLIE
You're talking about those sheep they show on late-night T.V.?

MS. FIDERER
Well, they're alpacas, and if you knew that, you'd know that the textiles
made from their
fiber are coveted by the best fashion houses.

CHARLIE
You swallowed a brochure?

MS. FIDERER
I have two of the Huacaya variety.

CHARLIE
You were Executive to the head of the U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee,

MS. FIDERER
Yes.

CHARLIE
I'm sending a car for you in 90 minutes. [heads for the door]

MS. FIDERER
I was fired from The White House, Charlie.

CHARLIE
I know you were.

Charlie opens the door. Ms. Fiderer watches him leave.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Agent Simon Donovan, in casual clothes, walks in with a young black man,
Anthony.

SIMON
You know what you should do? You should bring your mom a souvenir from The
White House.
Everyday, you should show your mom some expression of love. A smile. "You
look pretty
today, mom." A good smack on the ass they always like.

Anthony chuckles.

SIMON
You know why you should give your mom an expression of love everyday?

ANTHONY
'Cause she raised me?

SIMON
Well, okay. I was gonna say just to make things easier.

Simon pushes the doors to JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA, where he starts getting coffee.

ANTHONY
So, you're gonna be careful in New York, right?

SIMON
We're only going for a few hours.

ANTHONY
No, I mean when the crazy guy shows up.

SIMON
You don't think I can handle myself?

ANTHONY
Well...

SIMON
What?

ANTHONY
You got skills. I don't deny that. You can shoot, and you're athletic.

SIMON
But?

ANTHONY
You're slow-witted.

SIMON
Let the beatings begin.

ANTHONY
[laughs] You're not very bright, and the criminals can sense this about you.

Simon taps Anthony's face a couple of times and grabs his head for a headlock.

SIMON
Come here.

C.J.
Good morning.

C.J. is standing in the middle of the hallway, watching them. Simon lets
Anthony go and
almost dutifully stands to the side.

SIMON
Good morning.

C.J.
I thought you weren't on 'til this afternoon.

SIMON
I'm not. I arranged this for my friend Anthony here. Anthony, this is
Ms. Cregg.

ANTHONY
Hi.

C.J.
Hey. [They shake hands.]

SIMON
You think it's possible for Anthony to get a souvenir he can give to his mom?

C.J.
Sure, it is. [calls] Carol? [to Anthony] That's really sweet, Anthony. Doing
something
nice for your mom. [taps Simon on the shoulder] You should be like that.

SIMON
Yes.

Carol walks up.

C.J.
Could you set this gentleman up with a keychain?

CAROL
Yup. [walks off]

C.J.
It'll have the Seal of the President on it, and President Bartlet's signature,
and you
can tell your mom that you can't buy this in a souvenir shop. In fact,
you can't buy it
anywhere 'cause it's against the law to sell the Seal of the President. You
can only get
it here.

ANTHONY
Yeah, but if the cops stopped me, aren't they gonna think I stole it?

C.J.
If the cops stopped you, they're gonna think you're an important person.

SIMON
Stop you for what?

ANTHONY
Whatever.

SIMON
Wait outside a second, will you?

ANTHONY
Yeah.

C.J.
Nice meeting you.

Anthony heads to the lobby. Simon and C.J. go inside C.J.'S OFFICE.

C.J.
Is he your nephew?

SIMON
No. I'm a Big Brother. We've been together about three years.

C.J.
Are you good at it?

SIMON
I don't know. He says he wants to be a Big Brother when he gets older,
so you know,
I guess...

C.J.
Listen. I was thinking there's really no reason for you to make the trip to
New York.

SIMON
Yeah?

C.J.
I'm gonna be traveling with the President the whole time.

SIMON
Can I say something?

C.J.
Sure.

SIMON
I'm not allowed to date a protectee.

C.J.
Who's trying to date you?

SIMON
I'm not allowed to kiss a protectee.

C.J.
Who's trying to kiss you?

SIMON
You did.

C.J.
No, I didn't.

SIMON
C.J., I'm trusted with a serious job.

C.J.
Aren't you not allowed to call a protectee by their first name?

SIMON
Yes, ma'am. I'm gonna take Anthony home.

C.J.
There's really no reason for you to come to New York.

SIMON
See you on the plane.

C.J. watches Simon go.

CUT TO: INT. THE PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE STUDY - DAY
Bartlet is in another session with the psychiatrist, Dr. Stanley Keyworth.

BARTLET
It's "The War of the Roses." All the Henrys, and all the Richards, for that
matter.

STANLEY
In some kind of condensed form?

BARTLET
Yeah.

STANLEY
'Cause you'd be there for weeks, right, if...?

BARTLET
Yeah. There's also singing.

STANLEY
Oh, it's a musical?

BARTLET
No, but they're gonna sing from time to time, and one of the songs is a song
I love.
I can't think of the name now, but it's an Edwardian... It always reminds
me... It makes
me think of college, like, I don't know, like they should be singing it in
the dining
hall at Christ College at Cambridge. The chorus is, "And victorious in war
shall be made
glorious in peace." I was just singing it this morning.

A moment of silence.

STANLEY
How have you been sleeping?

BARTLET
Good. Yeah. Let me ask you something. Is there a crime, which if it wasn't
illegal, you
would do?

STANLEY
I'd park anywhere I want.

BARTLET
Right, but you wouldn't rob a bank?

STANLEY
No.

BARTLET
Connecticut had a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. It was written
out of rage
against adultery. But in the age of AIDS, don't Connecticut residents do
more for the
general welfare by flagrantly breaking the law?

STANLEY
There was a law against... contraceptives?

BARTLET
Yeah.

STANLEY
Can I ask, sir, how somebody used to get caught?

BARTLET
Stanley...

STANLEY
What's on your mind, Mr. President?

BARTLET
I can't tell you.

STANLEY
Yeah, but you can.

Bartlet pauses, looks away and thinks.

BARTLET
No, I really can't. It's high security. To say nothing of... [sighs heavily]

STANLEY
To say nothing of what?

BARTLET
If I tell you I intend to commit a crime, you're required by law to report
it. [beat]
I have a strange meeting coming up. [beat] I'm gonna go. It's good seeing you.

Bartlet stands, grabs his jacket, and leaves Stanley inside.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY
Sam and Toby are meeting with a Congressman. Toby paces.

CONGRESSMAN
Go ahead without the governors. You're asking for trouble.

SAM
You co-sponsored the bill.

CONGRESSMAN
Yeah. I'm saying if you increase the work hours, for example, what would
the governors do
if there aren't enough jobs?

SAM
I don't even understand that.

TOBY
I don't think the congressman is here as a co-sponsor of the bill, Sam. I
think he's here
as the leader of Florida's Republican Delegation.

CONGRESSMAN
The President should meet with Ritchie tonight.

SAM
That's not gonna happen

CONGRESSMAN
They should walk in the door together.

SAM
Walk in the door together?

TOBY
It's a Catholic fundraiser, Ted. It's not a network debate.

CONGRESSMAN
They should walk in the door together. They should go in a room and talk,
and then they
should watch the play. And there are five congressmen who would be interested
in the
outcome of that meeting.

SAM
We get the votes... if the President meets with Ritchie?

CONGRESSMAN
Yes.

TOBY
Ted, the President enters the room with his wife and the President of
China. He doesn't
do it with the governor of Florida.

CUT TO: INT. THE MURAL ROOM - DAY
Josh is meeting with three no votes on the welfare bill.

MAN 1
Can I ask why you guys are taking on a Broadway show during a vote like this?

JOSH
It was a scheduling error.

MAN 1
[sits] It was.

JOSH
Nonetheless...

MAN 1
I've got a primary.

JOSH
I know.

MAN 2
I'm spending money already.

JOSH
We can help you raise money.

MAN 3
So can Amy Gardner.

JOSH
Look, there's a billion more for child care. This isn't a bad bill. We're
fixing ten
things...

MAN 1
How are the women...?

JOSH
...that were wrong with welfare. Transportation subsidies...

MAN 1
How are the women supposed to train for life after welfare when they're
required to work
38 hours a week?

MAN 3
Forget the work hours. It's the marriage incentives. I can't run without
women.

JOSH
[pause] All right. These are three 'no' votes, right?

MAN 1
Yeah.

JOSH
[stands] Okay. The President's gonna call you.

MAN 1
Do you know when?

JOSH
[walking out] No. Sometime during the first intermission.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
In the hands of ABDUL SHAREEF is the box containing Bartlet's gift. Standing
in the middle
of the room, Bartlet listens to Shareef's Arabic, while the translator waits
by the side.
Leo and Fitzwallace stand by the corner, while two men stand just by the
doorway.
The translator speaks when Shareef is finished.

TRANSLATOR
And that the friendship established long ago between the United States and
the nation of
Qumar is based on frankness and serves the interests of both the American
and Qumari people.

BARTLET
[indicating the men by the door] Who are these men?

The translator asks Shareef, who responds.

TRANSLATOR
Bodyguards.

BARTLET
Okay.

Shareef speaks again.

TRANSLATOR
And I would personally like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the
renewal of your
ten-year lease on the Air Base in Tiaret.

BARTLET
Yeah, I'm feeling particularly proud of that today.

The translator interprets.

BARTLET
We're happy you visited us, Mr. Defense Minister. You're welcome here anytime,
and please,
send the best regards of the President of the United States to the Royal
Sultan.

The translator interprets again. Shareef offers his hand. Bartlet just looks
at him.

BARTLET
Not in the Oval Office.

TRANSLATOR
Sir?

BARTLET
Tell him I have a rash on my hand. Make sure you apologize.

He translates. A little confused, Shareef slowly drops his hand. He says a
word before leaving
with his bodyguards.

BARTLET
Yeah. [to the translator] Thanks.

TRANSLATOR
Yes, sir. [leaves]

A moment of silence after the guests leave. Bartlet looks down at Shareef's
gift.

BARTLET
It's a hand-carved incense burner. Gypsum and sandalwood.

He throws the incense burner in Fitzwallace's direction. Before he catches
it, we--

CUT TO: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Toby's pink ball bounces off the window, catching Sam's attention. Sam walks
to the window
to look through from his office. Toby bounces the ball on the window again. Sam
walks to
Toby's door.

SAM
What's up?

TOBY
A.P. called with a quote from Kevin Kahn. [reads from a note] "Governor
Ritchie is looking
forward to meeting with the President tonight so he could talk about the
Federal Government's
plan for the Everglades, which would tax sugar farmers into unemployment."

SAM
It wouldn't.

TOBY
Yeah, but now he's got another "What's Bartlet hiding from us today?" spot.

SAM
What about this? Call A.P. and tell them that Governor Ritchie is mistaken
and that he is not
on the President's schedule, and go further. Say the President would love
to meet with Ritchie,
but he's gonna be busy tonight passing a vote...

TOBY
...that's being hung up by the Florida delegation.

Toby sees Josh passing by.

TOBY
Josh?

JOSH
[walking up] Yeah?

TOBY
In response to a tactical leak from Kevin Kahn, I'm gonna let A.P. know that
Florida's messing
with the welfare vote. You all right with that?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
I'm asking 'cause if we lose the vote then we've just said that he's the
one that brought
us down.

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
You all right with this?

JOSH
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
From the sign next to the doorway that says, "PRIVATE, OFFICE OF THE
PRESIDENT," the camera
pans to a view inside, just as Ms. Fiderer walks in. She looks over the
empty desk of the
President's personal secretary. Charlie walks in.

MS. FIDERER
Oh, hello.

CHARLIE
Good. I was worried you were gonna be late.

MS. FIDERER
No.

CHARLIE
You want some water or something?

MS. FIDERER
No. No, thanks. [reveals a bottle of water from her purse]

CHARLIE
Have you met him before?

MS. FIDERER
We shook hands for a second before a group picture.

CHARLIE
You'll be fine.

MS. FIDERER
Yeah. [drinks]

CHARLIE
You seem a little better than you were before.

MS. FIDERER
I took a pill.

CHARLIE
Why?

MS. FIDERER
Because I was a little nervous about coming back to the White House.

CHARLIE
You took a pill?

MS. FIDERER
I took a couple.

NANCY
She can go on in now.

Nancy and several other staffers march their way out of THE OVAL
OFFICE. Charlie walks in.
Ms. Fiderer tries not to bump to the exiting staffers, shifting left and
right, as she
walks in. Bartlet walks to his desk. Ms. Fiderer stands in front.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, this is Deborah Fiderer. I'll be right outside. [exits]

BARTLET
It's Fiderer?

MS. FIDERER
Fideler. Fiderer. It's Fiderer.

BARTLET
[while signing papers] I saw your resume, so we don't need to talk about
that. What have you
been doing recently?

MS. FIDERER
I'm an alpaca farmer.

BARTLET
Like the sweaters?

MS. FIDERER
Before they're sweaters.

BARTLET
Uh-huh. And before that?

MS. FIDERER
[rolls her eyes] Craps and blackjack.

BARTLET
You're a professional gambler.

MS. FIDERER
I like the way that sounds.

BARTLET
Whereabouts?

MS. FIDERER
Bally's... mostly.

BARTLET
Okay. Why did you leave the White House?

MS. FIDERER
Well, Mr. President, if you want to talk about getting screwed with your
pants on...

She drops her bottled water, bends down and picks it up.

BARTLET
Charlie!

MS. FIDERER
I guess I... I got pretty-pretty well-doinked.

CHARLIE
[walks in] Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Can I have a minute?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[to Ms. Fiderer] Would you mind waiting outside just a moment?

MS. FIDERER
[as she walks out] No, not at all.

BARTLET
[to Charlie] Is this a joke? If it's a joke, it's both funny and well-executed,
but I think
you and I both know that it's not. I send you out to replace Delores
Landingham, and that's
what you came home with?

CHARLIE
Was she...?

BARTLET
She was an alpaca farmer who needed two tries to get her own name.

CHARLIE
Well, sir, maybe...

BARTLET
Don't worry about it. I'm gonna get the Personnel Office on it. I got to go
change for
New York.

Bartlet rushes out to the portico. Charlie walks out to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE,
shaking his
head. Ms. Fiderer is waiting.

CHARLIE
Okay. Okay, that was my fault. I didn't properly prepare you for the
meeting. That was bad
staff work. Before your next job interview with the President, I'm gonna
remind you that you
probably don't want to be stoned.

MS. FIDERER
There's gonna be a second interview?

CHARLIE
There's gonna be as many as it takes. We're gonna get this right.

They start to walk out.

MS. FIDERER
Well, let me back you up a second. Have we done the first one yet?

CHARLIE
I'm calling a cab now.

MS. FIDERER
Okay. [beat] Whatever happened to the Swingle Singers?

CHARLIE
I don't know.

CUT TO: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
A number of politicians are gathered around a round table. Each have a copy
of a file in front
of them. Two seats are left empty. They are for Leo and Fitzwallace, both
of whom walk inside.

LEO
Good afternoon.

Everyone sits. Leo starts.

LEO
After being presented with overwhelming evidence, provided by foreign and
domestic
intelligence agencies, the President requested the intelligence finding you
have in your
hands right now. That finding has been prepared and signed off by the
directors of the
NSA and Central Intelligence.

FITZWALLACE
It was subsequently submitted for review and approval by the National Security
Advisor, the
Secretaries of State and Defense, Attorney General, White House Counsel,
and finally, myself,
and I submit it to you for notification.

MAN 1
How are you getting around 1-1-9-0-5?

LEO
The President's rescinding his own Executive Order.

MAN 2
He's on U.S. soil right now. Why can't the FBI act on this?

LEO
The FBI's role is investigatory. They're not allowed to engage in a police
action.

MAN 3
And the military?

LOBELL
Posse Comitatus. You're killing Shareef?

LEO
[pause] I don't know.

MAN 1
Leo, when does the President give the green light?

LEO
At the last possible minute. Consider yourselves notified. Thank you. I have
theater tickets.

They all rise as Leo walks out.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: EXT. TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
The bright lights illuminate the night sky, as two security vans equipped
with police lights
drive by. Sirens are heard everywhere.

CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE THE BROADWAY THEATER - CONTINUOUS
The camera pans down from the sign "The Wars of the Roses" to the street
below, where the two
security vans pass by. A number of policemen and agents are on toll, as
theater patrons,
church officials and reporters are gathered near the entrance. The camera
continues down to
an open security van parked nearby. The agents inside are looking over a
detailed map.

RON
The secure exits are indicated in red. The site agents are standing post.

MALE AGENT
Yes, sir.

RON
And the U.D.?

FEMALE AGENT
Yeah.

RON
They can bring the dogs in. Thank you.

Ron turns to the street and calls on Simon, who approaches.

RON
Simon?

SIMON
Yes, sir.

RON
We've got a lead. I think I'm gonna have news for you in a few minutes.

SIMON
Is that right?

RON
Yeah.

SIMON
Thank you.

Ron walks away. Simon turns to the entrance, where he sees C.J. come out of
the theater.
She walks over to a few reporters, just as Simon immediately heads her
direction.

REPORTER 1
C.J.!

REPORTER 2
Hey C.J.

C.J.
How you guys doing?

REPORTER 1
C.J., the President running on time?

C.J.
Just about.

Simon nonchalantly whisks C.J. away and pulls her to a deserted alley. The
wind blows hard.

SIMON
I asked you to wait with an agent.

C.J.
I wanted to get some air.

SIMON
That's fine, but I asked you to wait with an agent.

C.J.
Simon...

SIMON
You can say to the agent, "I'd like to go outside and get some air," and
he'll go with you.

C.J.
I'm standing in the middle of the President's security detail. What do you
think's gonna
happen to me?

SIMON
[raises voice] I don't know what's gonna happen to you. If I did, this would
be easy!

C.J.
Maybe if we didn't shout so much.

SIMON
I have spent my adult life protecting people. You're the first person who's
got me seriously
thinking about switching sides.

C.J.
Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way. I think I've been a treat.

SIMON
[sarcastic] Oh, yes you have. A little Easter treat. Just for me.

C.J.
You seem a little riled.

SIMON
[angry] From the first day, you've acted like this is all my fault, when
that's a pretty tough
case to make.

C.J.
I don't think any of it's your fault, and I appreciate everything you've done.

SIMON
I got to say, there are times when it seems like you like me.

C.J.
I do like you.

SIMON
Then you just walk off to stick it to me, and forget the personalities. It's
just stupid!

C.J.
I said I do like you.

SIMON
I meant the other way!

C.J.
So did I. I tried to kiss you.

SIMON
You said you didn't!

C.J.
I was lying, you idiot.

SIMON
All right. I'm switching sides now.

C.J.
I was embarrassed. I fumbled it.

SIMON
You didn't. I told you. I'm not allowed!

C.J.
It sounded like an excuse.

SIMON
It's not. Somebody is threatening to kill you. I can't be... I watched you
for three seconds
trying on dresses in Barney's, and the guy shows up... I can't be...

C.J.
You watched me at Barney's?

SIMON
You're like the girl in Driver's Ed. who won't watch the prom night movie
becuase it's gross,
and so ends up missing an important lesson about drinking and driving.

Simon's phone rings. He starts to answer it.

C.J.
[laughs] What in God's name are you talking about?

SIMON
[into phone] Simon Donovan.

He walks. C.J. follows.

C.J.
You're saying I need to take my protection more seriously? 'Cause Simon,
this is happening
to me. I think I take the situation plenty seriously, but I have to live my
life, so maybe...

SIMON
[stops] I have a phone to my ear. What does that mean to you?

C.J.
I shouldn't be talking.

SIMON
[into phone] Yes, sir. [listens] Thank you.

Simon hangs up and turns to C.J.

SIMON
They've got him.

C.J.
What do you mean?

SIMON
We have him in custody. It's him. [into wrist mic] 10-50. It's Donovan. They
got my guy.

C.J.
They have him?

SIMON
They stopped his train in Trenton.

C.J.
Where was he going?

SIMON
Here. He wasn't gonna do anything to you.

C.J.
This is over.

SIMON
There's paperwork.

C.J.
I meant for me.

SIMON
Yeah.

C.J.
Thank you.

SIMON
You're welcome.

C.J.
Seriously.

C.J. leans in to kiss Simon on the cheek. They get comfortably close. Without
resistance, they
kiss passionately. It was a kiss weeks in the making. Well worth the wait. A
long savored
moment passes before they let go. They stay close, as if they can't get
enough of each other.
They speak softly.

C.J.
Thanks.

SIMON
You can drive your car, walk in a crowd, eat a grapefruit, do what you want.

C.J.
How about a drink?

SIMON
Sure, you can drink.

C.J.
Can you meet me after the play?

SIMON
Yes.

C.J.
Good.

SIMON
Where?

C.J.
Anywhere you want.

SIMON
How about right here?

Nearby, the sirens announce the arrival of the President's motorcade.

C.J.
I have to go to work.

C.J. turns and walks back, a big smile on her face. The crowd start to
applaud and cheer as
Bartlet comes out of his limo. Leo, Toby, Sam and the rest of the staff come
out too. Bartlet
shakes hands with several Catholic church officials and waves to the crowd
across the street.
The camera pans up to the sign again: "The Wars of the Roses."

CUT TO: INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT
The stage lights are dim as a man speaks.

MAN
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day and night.

The audience applauds as the trumpets play, marking the start of the
Shakespeare Company play.
The curtain rises for the first scene. The stage actors, all in periodic
clothing, stay
frozen, as a man center stage raises his sword and starts his monologue. While
he does,
the camera pans up to the theater balconies, passes by the President's,
and into the rearmost,
where Sam walks up and pokes Toby on the shoulder.

MAN
Comets, importing changes of time and states, brandish your crystal tresses
in the sky, and
with them scourge the bad revolting stars that have consented unto Henry's
death. King Henry
the fifth, too famous to live long, virtue he had, deserving to command. He
ne'er lift up his
hand, but conquered.

In the back balcony, Toby stands and follows Sam outside.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Sam and Toby walk down a small flight of stairs into a well-decorated hallway.

SAM
He went to the Yankee game.

TOBY
Ritchie?

SAM
Yes.

TOBY
He's at the Yankee game right now?

SAM
Local news covered it. He said this was how ordinary Americans got their
entertainment.

TOBY
I've been to 441 baseball games in Yankee Stadium. There's not a single
person there who's
ordinary.

SAM
I know.

TOBY
You making fun of the Yankees?

SAM
No.

TOBY
Now?

SAM
I'm not.

TOBY
They went to the Yankee game.

SAM
He's coming at intermission.

TOBY
Well, I'm not sure that suits me.

SAM
I know what you mean.

TOBY
Making an entrance after the President. That's just not how we play
bridge. It's not how
we say cricket.

SAM
Okay, but you're starting to freak me out a little bit.

TOBY
Just talk to me a minute.

SAM
How many people are at the game?

TOBY
It's a good game. About 40,000 probably.

SAM
There was an incumbent President, who was facing a primary challenge, and
on the day of the
primary, his staff sent his motorcade into a district that was heavily
favored by his
opponent in order to tie up traffic. Now I would like it plain that I would
never do anything
to temper an election, but...

Toby pats Sam's cheek a few times and squishes his mouth.

TOBY
I am so... proud of you.

SAM
You're really very much freaking me out.

Toby starts to fish his pocket for his cell phone.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Donna appears at the door.

DONNA
It's Toby on One.

She leaves. Josh picks up the phone and presses a button.

JOSH
Hey.

TOBY
Hey.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Toby continues talking to Josh on the phone, while Sam paces in front of him.

TOBY
Listen, I'm gonna send the motorcade up to Major Deegan. Is that okay with
you?

JOSH
Why?

TOBY
[to Sam] Josh has a good point. We should think of a reason.

JOSH
Why don't you guys get back to me?

TOBY
How's it going?

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JOSH
They'll start voting in about half an hour.

TOBY
You bringing in Brenda?

JOSH
Yeah.

TOBY
I didn't hear you.

JOSH
Yeah, we're bringing in Brenda. We're gonna make her Chairman of the Platform
Committee.

TOBY
Hey, did I put too much pressure on you with the vote?

JOSH
No.

TOBY
With the Ritchie meeting and the A.P. quote?

JOSH
No.

TOBY
And I understand the President jumped up and down on you pretty hard last
week.

JOSH
It's over, Toby. We won.

TOBY
Amy's incredibly employable, Josh.

JOSH
[chuckles lightly] All right.

TOBY
All right.

Josh hangs up the phone. An expression of guilt and exhaustion is on his face,
even though
he won the vote. Donna has been leaning on the doorway, listening.

DONNA
You did all right, okay?

JOSH
I bought her boss.

DONNA
Yeah, that's how you had to win this one. You think her job's really in
jeopardy?

JOSH
No, she'll lose it for sure. Anyway, good job. [stands] See you tomorrow.

DONNA
You're not gonna stick around for the vote?

JOSH
We won by eight.

Donna watches Josh leave the office. After a moment, she leaves as well.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. SECURITY VAN - NIGHT
An agent watches the surveillance monitors. Shown on all three screens,
Toby and Sam talks
to some reporters in the designated press area.

REPORTER 1 [VO]
Toby, it's already intermission, and Governor Ritchie's stuck in traffic. He
won't get here
until the middle of the second act.

CUT TO: EXT. PRESS AREA - CONTINUOUS

TOBY
He should have take the Cross Bronx to the West Side.

REPORTER 2
Sam?

SAM
I don't know... but I want to tell you some good facts. $1.8 million raised
for the Catholic
charities tonight. Thanks to the people who made it. While we're talking,
the House is passing
the President's welfare reform bill, and he appreciates all the governors
who worked the vote.

TOBY
And the Yankees are about to snap a 12-game winning streak. Thanks a lot.

SAM
What Toby means to say that if 90% of success is showing up, we're just
happy that someone's
standing up for the other ten.

Sam and Toby turn to leave.

TOBY
I love the theater.

SAM
I know what you mean.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bartlet is posing for pictures with a couple, while Charlie waits. When
finished, the couple
say their thanks. Bartlet walks with Charlie.

BARTLET
What's going on?

CHARLIE
Nothing, sir. [beat] I'll be arranging a second meeting with Deborah Fiderer
when we get
back to town.

BARTLET
From this afternoon?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Are you pledging a fraternity or something, 'cause this would be a good one.

CHARLIE
Sir? [stops]

BARTLET
What's with you and this woman?

CHARLIE
She hired me. That's why she was fired.

Bartlet, a little surprised, just nods in agreement. They walk again.

CUT TO: INT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
A sharp-dressed, supposedly off-duty Simon Donovan walks in happily inside
the convenience
store. He walks past the bright flowers on the side and straight to the
candy stand. The
Korean grocer behind the counter stands still, while a customer by the corner
browses the
fruit stand. Simon grabs a Milky Way bar.

SIMON
[to the grocer] You happen to know if a Milky Way bar has red in it?

He turns to the counter. The grocer, with his thick glasses, stays still,
looking down.

SIMON
Sorry. Kidding. I'm gonna buy this, and... [looks at the flowers] ...and a
flower.

GROCER
[quietly] No, no. We don't have that.

SIMON
No, I mean I'm gonna buy this. How much is it?

GROCER
No. It-It's okay.

SIMON
No. How much is it?

GROCER
You can go.

Simon sees the open drawer of the cash machine. It's empty. The grocer is
still in shock
after the robbery.

SIMON
It's all right.

The grocer backs a little when Simon pulls out his pistol from his concealed
holster.
He quickly cocks the gun and turns around, pointing the loaded weapon to
the suspicious
guy by the fruit stand.

SIMON
Don't move at all. I'm a Federal officer.

The suspected man in the plain gray sweatshirt moves his hand.

SIMON
Don't reach. I'm Secret Service. You know you'll never get there. Put your
hands in the air.

The man complies as Simon steps closer. His gun is still aimed at the culprit.

SIMON
That's it. I want you to lie down face first on the floor. Let's go.

The man nervously lies down on his stomach. Simon reaches him and puts both
of the man's hands
behind the back.

SIMON
Keep it up. You're doing great.

Simon confiscates the man's weapon. He takes off his bow tie and uses it to
cuff the man's
hands. The grocer watches carefully behind his counter.

SIMON
You shouldn't get down on yourself. A Secret Service agent walking in the
middle of an armed
robbery -- that's just bad luck. You lie still, okay?

Simon stands and speaks to his wrist mic, while slowly making his way back
to the counter.

SIMON
This is Donovan. I need NYPD at a Korean grocery at 98th and Broadway. [to
the grocer] Sir,
I hate to be a problem customer, but if I don't get a Milky Way bar pretty
soon...

He is interrupted by movement and did not have time to react. Simon is
immediately thrown
backward by three deafening shots. A second robber has been hiding in the
back aisle. The
long-haired goon runs outside after shooting Simon. The grocer panics. He
looks at Simon's
body and runs out as well. In the background, a melancholy tune starts to
play.

CUT TO: INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT
The play continues. Bartlet watches from his balcony.

WOMAN
Too... too unpardonable. Off with the crown, and with the crown, his head. And
whilst we
breathe, take time to do him dead.

YOUNG MAN
That is my office for my father's sake.

WOMAN
Nay. Stay. Let's hear the orisons he makes.

OLDER MAN
She-wolf of France! But worse than wolves of France, whose tongue more
poisons...

Bartlet stands and leaves. In the other balcony, Ron gets C.J.'s
attention. They walk out.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Ron delivers the horrible news. C.J. listens attentively. Outside, a barrage
of lights shine.
The song "Hallelujah" continues.

	I heard there was a secret chord
	That David played and it pleased the Lord
	But you don't really care for music, do you?

C.J.
Somebody's made a mistake. He was just on his way to the field office...

RON
No.

C.J. tries hard to accept the news, putting her hand on her forehead. The
song drains out
their conversation.

	It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
	The minor fall, the major lift
	The baffled king composing hallelujahs.
	Hallelujah...

C.J.
Excuse me.

CUT TO: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
The police have arrived, taking pictures of Simon's body. He is still down
on the ground,
beside the many flowers.

	Hallelujah...

CUT TO: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
C.J. is teary-eyed. She walks amongst the people, the lights, the
confusion. She bumps into
someone, who just walks on.

	Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
	You saw her bathing on the roof
	Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
	She tied you to a kitchen chair
	She broke your throne, she cut your hair
	And from your lips, she drew the hallelujah.
	Hallelujah, Hallelujah...

C.J. finds a bench to sit on. She gazes up and ahead, still crying.

CUT TO: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
Ron sees the fallen agent, and kneels down beside him.

	Hallelujah, Hallelujah...

CUT TO: INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Josh and Amy walk to the kitchen. The same song is faintly heard in the
background.

JOSH
What'd you think I was gonna do?

AMY
I thought you were gonna do this.

JOSH
And?

AMY
And I didn't think it was gonna work.

JOSH
Are you fired?

AMY
I'm resigning on Monday.

JOSH
Do you have to?

AMY
I had an entire policy initiative reversed in an hour. Weren't you given
the chance to get
the votes you needed by setting up a meeting with Ritchie?

JOSH
I'm not a dating service.

AMY
[slams the fridge] What is wrong with you?!

JOSH
Every serious Democrat is gonna unite behind this President, and I'm not
kidding around.

AMY
Every serious Democrat should be thinking about leading and not following.

JOSH
Yeah? How's it going so far?

AMY
Matter of fact, it's going all right, and I'd do it again.

JOSH
That's what's scaring the hell out of me.

AMY
Good. It's about time.

The phone in the living room rings.

JOSH
You can't win the White House while the middle class thinks you disdain work
and responsibility.

AMY
I would hope not, and I congratulate you for punishing poor women as the
symbol of the
strength of mainstream values.

JOSH
That's not what we did.

Amy walks to the phone and picks it up.

AMY
Hello?

JOSH
Do you not consider it relevant that it would be worse with Rob Ritchie in
the White House?
Why is that not part of the equation?

AMY
Honey, Simon Donovan was shot and killed.

Josh stops and reaches to answer the phone.

	And the holy dove was moving too
	And every breath we drew was hallelujah.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Hallelujah...

It's the play's first intermission. Leo walks along the dark terrace
hallway. He sees Bartlet
by the corner, peering downstairs. They meet and talk quietly.

BARTLET
Civilians get trials.

LEO
I'd argue he's not a civilian. So would the Attorney General.

BARTLET
They're gonna find out it's us. We could make it look like the plane went
down, but they're
gonna find out it's us, and I'm gonna be running for reelection while I'm
fighting a war
against Qumar.

LEO
That's why you want to say no?

BARTLET
I want him tried.

LEO
That can't happen.

BARTLET
I understand.

LEO
I was talking this morning about how Mallory names all the lobsters in the
tank.

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Would it be helpful if I brought you a list of names of Shareef's victims?

BARTLET
What do you want from me?

LEO
Who was the monk who wrote, "I always don't know the right thing to do,
Lord, but I think
the fact that I want to please you pleases you." [beat] You have two minutes,
sir.

BARTLET
This isn't a matter of religion.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I recognize that there's evil in the world.

LEO
What is your objection exactly, sir?

BARTLET
Doesn't this mean we join the league of ordinary nations?

LEO
That's your objection? I'm not gonna have trouble saying the Pledge of
Allegiance tomorrow.

BARTLET
That's not my objection.

LEO
Sir...

BARTLET
It's just wrong. It's absolutely wrong.

LEO
I know, but you have to do it anyway.

BARTLET
Why?

LEO
'Cause you won.

Bartlet pauses. He starts to walk away, but he stops right in front of Leo's
shoulder.

BARTLET
Take him.

He continues on his way. Silent. Leo grabs his phone and dials.

CUT TO: INT. THEATER MESS - NIGHT
Bartlet walks down a flight of stairs, past the men's bathroom. A shadow of
a man is cast
on the bathroom door, while the man washes his hands. Bartlet lights his
cigarette in the
mess. A female employee spots him.

BARTLET
[smiling] Caught me.

Behind Bartlet, Governor ROBERT RITCHIE exits the bathroom. Ritchie sees
the President and
approaches.

ROBERT RITCHIE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Governor.

RITCHIE
You enjoying the play?

BARTLET
I am. How about you?

RITCHIE
We just got here. We were at the Yankee game. We were, you know, hung up in
traffic.

BARTLET
Yeah, I know. Listen, politics aside, and I don't want to make a big deal
out of it, but
you probably insulted the church, and you can head it off at the pass if
you speak to the
Cardinal tonight.

RITCHIE
Well, I didn't mean to insult anybody.

BARTLET
No.

RITCHIE
And it's a baseball game. It's how ordinary Americans...

BARTLET
Yeah. [beat] No, I don't understand that. The center fielder for the Yankees
is an accomplished
classical guitarist. People who like baseball can't like books?

RITCHIE
Are you taking this personally?

BARTLET
No. Something horrible happened about an hour ago.

The two find a place to sit across each other.

BARTLET
C.J. Cregg was getting threats so we put an agent on her. He's a good guy. He
was on my
detail for a while, and he was in Rosslyn. He walked in the middle of an
armed robbery,
and was shot and killed after detaining one of the suspects.

RITCHIE
Oh. Crime. Boy, I don't know.

BARTLET
[sighs] We should have a great debate, Rob. We owe it to everyone. When I
was running as a
governor, I didn't know anything. I made them start Bartlet college in my
dining room.
Two hours every morning on foreign affairs and the military. You can do that.

RITCHIE
How many different ways you think you're gonna find to call me dumb?

BARTLET
I wasn't, Rob. But you've turned being un-engaged into a Zen-like thing,
and you shouldn't
enjoy it so much is all, and if it appears at times as if I don't like you,
that's the
reason why.

RITCHIE
You're what my friends call a superior sumbitch. You're an academic elitist
and a snob.
You're, uh, Hollywood, you're weak, you're liberal, and you can't be
trusted. And if it
appears from time to time as if I don't like you, well, those are just a
few of the many
reasons why.

The start of a great tune is played inside the theater.

BARTLET
They're playing my song.

Bartlet stands and heads to the stairs, but he turns to Ritchie before
reaching them.

BARTLET
In the future, if you're wondering, "Crime. Boy, I don't know" is when I
decided to kick
your ass.

Ritchie can't help but smile as Bartlet heads upstairs.

CUT TO: INT. BROADWAY THEATER - NIGHT
A bright, young boy runs center stage. He starts to sing.

	England arise. Join in the chorus.
	This is a new made song,
	You should be... singing.
	See in the skies, fluttering before us,
	What the bright bird of peace is bringing
	Ah...

Other actors walk on stage, joining the boy in the chorus.

	See upon a smiling land
	Where the wealth of nations stand.

CUT TO: EXT. REMOTE LANDING STRIP IN BERMUDA - NIGHT
A man distributes loaded rifles to each sniper. The chorus song is still
heard aloud.

	Where prosperity and industry
	Walk ever hand in hand.
	Where so many blessings crowd
	'Tis our duty to be proud.
	Up and answer English yeoman

CUT TO: INT. SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Fitzwallace is alone in the room, waiting by the phone. The song continues.

	Sing it joyfully aloud!

Back in the LANDING STRIP, a private plane lands. A sniper watches via night
vision.

	Every garner filled with grain
	Every meadow blessed with rain.

Abdul Shareef and his two bodyguards exit the plane. They look around
unknowingly. The
snipers take aim and fire, sending Shareef and the bodyguards down on the
ground. Dead.

	Rich and fertile is the golden corn
	That bears and bears again.

Bartlet stares at the stage THEATER. In the LANDING STRIP, one of the snipers
takes the pen
recorder from Shareef and attaches it to a compatible phone. Fitzwallace
picks up the phone
in the SITUATION ROOM.

	Where so many blessings crowd
	'Tis our duty to be proud.

In the theater HALLWAY, Leo answers his phone. Bartlet turns his head to look.

	Up and answer English yeoman
	Sing it joyfully aloud!

The actors in the stage are now waving several flags. From behind them,
the lights get
blocked from time to time. In the hallway, Leo hangs up. Bartlet stands.

	Upon our country
	God will pour his rich increase,

Bartlet and Leo meet. Bled out by the loud singing, Leo relays the news
before walking away.

	And victorious in war
	Shall be made glorious in peace.
	Glorious in peace.
	Glorious in peace.
	Glorious in peace.
	Glorious...

Bartlet steps behind a curtain, casting a silhouette. For a while, Bartlet's
shadow just
stands out, and it is the only thing we see.

	...in peace!
	In peace! In peace!

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
