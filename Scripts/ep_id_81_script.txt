FADE IN: INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

	UNITED STATES CAPITOL SUNDAY
	INAUGURATION DAY

Bartlet is walking with Ed, Larry and several aids through the lobby when C.J.
approaches him.

C.J.
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Why are they talking to me about the order of the balls?

C.J.
Political Affairs thinks it's important.

LARRY
They'd like you to start with the Plain States, followed by the Rust Belt Ball,
then the one from the Pacific Northwest.

ED
It shows you're President of the whole country.

C.J.
Aren't we about to demonstrate that pretty clearly right now?

ED
He could start with the New Hampshire ball.

LARRY
Make it clear he knows where he came from.

C.J.
The President has a driver's license.

LARRY
What if he starts with all the states where jobs are in decline-- make it
clear our
message is the economy.

BARTLET
Well, that's only going to be clear if we also hand out decoder rings. Listen,
it's
an Inauguration Ball. Let's enjoy ourselves.

ED and LARRY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.

LARRY
Knock 'em dead, sir.

ED
Game on, sir.

Ed, Larry and the rest of the staff depart.

C.J.
Actually, it's eight Inauguration Balls.

BARTLET
You read it?

C.J.
Every draft all night long.

BARTLET
You haven't weighed in.

C.J. leans over and kisses him on the cheek.

C.J.
I just did. Anything else, sir?

BARTLET
No.

C.J. starts to walk away, but yells back.

C.J.
Eat 'em up, Chief.

BARTLET
Thank you, Claudia.

Bartlet walks into GREEN ROOM where he spots Josh.

BARTLET
Josh.

JOSH
It's leaked.

BARTLET
How much?

JOSH
Just buzz. They know there's a restatement of foreign objectives. They know the
committee chairmen haven't been consultated.

BARTLET
Yeah.

JOSH
They know it changed a lot overnight.

BARTLET
Well, their curiosity will be slacked in about 41 minutes. Listen.

JOSH
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
I have a problem.

JOSH
Well, you're about to propose the most massive shift in foreign policy
since the
Marshall Plan, and it's going to be wildly unpopular.

BARTLET
All right, two problems.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I don't have a bible.

JOSH
What do you mean?

BARTLET
I kept changing my mind all week on which bible I wanted to use, and then
I finally
settled on the George Washington Bible but we ran into a problem with the
New York
Freemasons, which we don't have time to get into.

JOSH
The Freemasons?

BARTLET
Yeah. Charlie's out hunting one down, but he's not back yet.

JOSH
You know, there's nothing that says you have to be sworn in on a bible.

BARTLET
Is that true?

JOSH
You can be sworn in on a Sports Illustrated swimsuit Issue.

BARTLET
You think that's a good idea?

JOSH
No.

BARTLET
You sure?

JOSH
I'll find Charlie.

BARTLET
Thanks.

JOSH
We're right next to you, sir. Knock 'em all down.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Bartlet walks into an even larger green room, while Josh turns around and
walks out
of the SMALLER GREEN ROOM where he meets Leo at the door.

LEO
Nice suit.

JOSH
Hey, Leo, can you tell me anything about what happened to Jack Reese?

LEO
The President asked him to get a Forced Depletion Report under the radar.

JOSH
On Khundu?

LEO
Yeah.

JOSH
And someone found out.

LEO
Hutchinson. It was my fault. Which doesn't excuse...

JOSH
I don't excuse it.

LEO
I don't know how she could do that, I really don't. I mean I don't want to talk
about it now, but do you suppose her timing could have been any worse?

JOSH
I told her all that in no uncertain terms.

LEO
I'll be telling it to her, too.

JOSH
She knows.

LEO
Good.

JOSH
She's not here. I can't find her. I don't think she's coming. I'll find
out where
Charlie is.

Josh walks away. Leo enters GREEN ROOM and a man walks up to him.

SENATOR BECKWITH
Leo.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BECKWITH
I know you've been under ground all night but, uh... there's a rumor that the
President's contemplating a new doctrine for the use of force.

LEO
The President's nothing if not contemplative, Senator. The man makes the Prince
of Denmark seem reactionary.

BECKWITH
No, I mean that he's going to talk about it right now.

LEO
He's the Commander-in-Chief. He's going to reserve the right to, you know,
command.

Leo walks away and enters into the LARGER GREEN ROOM where Bartlet and a
host of
other people are.

O'DONELL
Leo.

LEO
Mr. Leader.

O'DONELL
The Hill's going to go crazy.

LEO
For a refreshing change of pace.

O'DONELL
I've assured a dozen members that the White House wouldn't act without us.

LEO
Then you're all set. There's cheese over there.

Leo walks away and over to where Bartlet is standing talking to men in uniform.
When Leo walks up, the men leave.

LEO
Hello.

BARTLET
Hi.

LEO
You know, I saw the dress that Abbey's wearing tonight.

BARTLET
Yeah, I may need to get a room.

LEO
Do you know it's leaked?

BARTLET
No kidding. In the last two minutes, three people have reminded me what
Jefferson
said in his Inaugural.

LEO
"Peace, commerce, honest frienship with all nations and entangling alliances
with none."

BARTLET
The problem is that when he said it, your best chance of getting entangled
with an
ally was by rowboat.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
Charlie's here.

Charlie comes running up.

CHARLIE
Sir.

Charlie hands Bartlet a bible.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet opens the bible and reads the inside.

BARTLET
Donnie's Motel?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
They didn't have one in the House Library?

CHARLIE
This is the one from the House Library.

BARTLET
Okay.

The Chief Justice walks up.

CHIEF JUSTICE
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Mr. Chief Justice.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
Bartlet is standing at the podium.

C.J.
That's when the Chief Justice will ask you to raise your right hand and
place your
left hand on the Bible.

BARTLET
What do I do then?

C.J.
You raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible.

	MONDAY MORNING
	SIX DAYS BEFORE INAUGURATION

BARTLET
And will there be someone who'll tell me when it's time to do that?

C.J.
You mock me?

BARTLET
I do. May I continue?

C.J.
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[to prompter operator] Can we pull foreign policy up on the prompter?

TOBY
144 on the prompter, please. It's going to take a second.

Toby is reading a piece of paper and laughs to himself.

BARTLET
[to Toby] What's going on?

TOBY
The Chief Justice-- wrote a dissenting opinion in Sea Northern v. Arizona,
saying
that an association between asbestos and a higher risk of cancer in later
life was
insufficient to merit relief.

BARTLET
So what?

TOBY
He... [chuckles] I don't know how to say this. He wrote it in meter.

BARTLET
A meter?

TOBY
He wrote a dissenting opinion in what I am almost certain is trochiac
tetrometer.
Will?

WILL
It is.

BARTLET
What are you talking about?

TOBY
He starts in the fourth graph.

Toby walks up to the podium and hands the paper to Bartlet.

BARTLET
"Fear of cancer from asbestos, fuzzy science manifestos."

TOBY
A guy just faxed this to Will.

BARTLET
Which one's Will?

Toby points to Will standing in the back of the room.

TOBY
He is.

Will raises his hand.

TOBY
It's a loud syllable followed by a soft syllable, which is a trochaic foot,
then
there's four per comma, which is tetrameter.

C.J.
You think he's trying to tell us something through code?

TOBY
144's on the prompter, sir.

BARTLET
"America cannot be the world's policeman. America cannot enforce its own
values, its
own standards across the world. Yet when it's in our clear an vital
interests..."
We're being candid at least.

TOBY
This is State Department language.

BARTLET
No kidding. Look, I understand I present a uniform gap, but I want to mean
what I say.

TOBY
Will, you're going to meet with my counterpart, the State Department
Communications
Director. He likes to have input into foreign policy language.

WILL
Isn't he going to be insulted that he's meeting with someoone he's never
heard of,
who isn't a White House staffer?

TOBY
I would really think so.

LEO
That's all. Thank you.

The staffers exit. Bartlet and Leo walk out into the HALLWAY.

BARTLET
The Chief Justice wrote a poem.

LEO
He's trying to get the Court to adopt powdered wigs.

BARTLET
What do you mean?

LEO
Exactly what I said.

BARTLET
Powdered wigs?

LEO
Like the British magistrates. I'm telling you, I think there might be
a problem.

BARTLET
You think he stayed to long at the fair?

LEO
He's not a young man.

BARTLET
Neither am I.

LEO
This is what I'm talking about.

They stop in front of LEO'S OFFICE.

BARTLET
This foreign policy language is ridiculous.

LEO
It'll get fixed.

BARTLET
What's going on in Khundu?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
I got a short security cable this morning about civil unrest in the Republic of
Equatorial Khundu, and I had to reach for an atlas.

LEO
Near the Ivory Coast.

BARTLET
I know that now.

LEO
The government forces run by the Arkutu have apparently killed as many as
200 Induye
on the streets of Bitanga, which is the capitol.

BARTLET
Two warring tribes?

LEO
Well, no, one tribes warring, and the other one's getting killed. But the
point is
we got about 500 American missionaries.

BARTLET
They're being evacuated?

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Okay. Thank you.

Leo walks into his office and Charlie and Jed walk into THE OVAL OFFICE. Will
is
following behind them.

CHARLIE
Mr. President, I'm sorry to bother you about this.

BARTLET
Yeah?

CHARLIE
Mr. Hollowman says if you want to use the Goerge Washington Bible, they
need some
time to get it here.

BARTLET
From where?

CHARLIE
The Freemason's have the Washington Bible.

BARTLET
They do?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
And they need several days notice?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Why?

CHARLIE
I don't know, sir.

BARTLET
Are they not sure where it is?

CHARLIE
Should I tell Mr. Hollowman you're using it?

BARTLET
I'm going to be using the Bartlet Bible. That's at the New Hampshire
Historical Society.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Charlie exits and Bartlet notices Will standing in his office.

BARTLET
Yes.

WILL
Sir, just to be clear... You're hoping that there can be a broader
definition of
"vital interests."

BARTLET
Hoping beyond hope.

WILL
Thank you, sir.

Will starts to walk out, but when he gets to the door, he turns around.

WILL
There's a... partnership, sir, that can develop between someone and his
speechwriter.
It happens over time. You get to know just where he likes his commas and
why he says
self-government instead of governement. Why he doesn't like the word
"implement" but
does like the word "obfuscate". Like jazz musicians...

BARTLET
I can't remember your name, but are you asking me out on a date?

WILL
No, sir. It happens over time.

BARTLET
Okay.

WILL
Thank you, Mr. President.

Will exits into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

WILL
Charlie, do you happen to know if the New Hampshire State House has the
Governor
Bartlet's public statements?

CHARLIE
They do.

WILL
Any chance you could help me get them?

CHARLIE
Yeah, it's not a problem.

Will starts to walk out, but turns around.

WILL
And copies of his floor speeches from the House?

CHARLIE
I can also send a couple of people to the Library of Congress...

WILL
Everything he's ever said out loud in his life?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

WILL
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh is sitting at his desk working on the computer, when Donna knocks on the
doorframe and enters carrying a white envelope.

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Tickets came.

JOSH
For?

DONNA
The balls.

JOSH
Could you hang onto mine for me till Sunday?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
Thanks.

DONNA
You know what Jack will be wearing? A saber.

JOSH
God, Donna, please tell me that's not going to be the only thing he's wearing.

DONNA
No, he'll be wearing his dress blues. Warfare pin, Submarine Officer pin, two
commendation medals, meritorious unit, Purple Heart, Bronze Cross and a saber.

JOSH
I'll be wearing a tuxedo from Gary's. Who's been on the phone?

DONNA
Confused people from the State Department.

JOSH
They decided to change the foreign policy language 20 minutes ago. How do they
know already?

DONNA
They wanted to know why their Public Affairs Director was asked to meet with
Will Bailey.

JOSH
The President's asked Toby and Will to look at the language.

DONNA
Okay.

JOSH
Keep the President out of it. I've asked Toby and Will to look at the language.

DONNA
All right.

JOSH
Thanks.

DONNA
13 buttons on the trousers.

JOSH
[with an overly sweet smile] I don't want to know how you know that.

Donna smiles at Josh then walks out of his office. Josh continues to stare
after
her until she turns a corner.

CUT TO: INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Bartlet is attending a prayer breakfast. The room is full of various clerical
people.
They are standing around tables which are set with paltes of food, while
a Cardinal
says a prayer.

CARDINAL PATRICK
Heavenly Father, assist with your spirit of counsel and fortitude the
President of
the Untied states, that his administration may be conducted in righteousness,
and
be eminently useful to your people over whom he presides. And we ask this
morning
for the safe evacuation of the 500 American missionaries and their children
in the
Republic of Equatorial Khundu and for the people of Khundu, where horrible
violence
has broken out. We pray to you, who are Lord our God, forever and ever. Amen.

ALL
Amen.

They all sit and begin to eat breakfast.

ARCHBISHOP ZAKE KINTAKA
Patrick, you may pray all you wish, but thousands upon thousands African
children
will die unnless the U.S. intervenes. Tens of thousand of Khundunese
children and
their parents slaughtered.

PATRICK
Well, I don't control the armed forces, Zake.

BARTLET
No, he was talking to me, your Eminence. [to Zake] Your Excellency, I got
a very
sketchy intelligence report on the violence in the capitol about an hour ago.

ZAKE
The violence isn't limited to Bitanga, sir. It's spread to the countryside.

BARTLET
I didn't know that.

ZAKE
May I ask you something, sir, with all due respect, please?

BARTLET
Yes.

ZAKE
If mass genocide had broken out in a small European country, would your
intelligence
briefing this morning have been quite so sketchy?

BARTLET
No.

ZAKE
I join my colleagues in their prayers for the safe evacuation of the Americans.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. WILL'S OFFICE - DAY
Will is sitting at his desk when Bonnie knocks on the door and enters.

BONNIE
Okay, Will, you ready? This is Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs,
Bryce Lilly.

WILL
Thank you.

BRYCE LILLY enters Will's office.

WILL
Mr. Secretary.

BRYCE LILLY
Bailey?

WILL
Will Bailey, yes, sir.

BRYCE
You... are young.

WILL
Uh, thank you. Have a seat please.

BRYCE
Thank you.

They sit.

WILL
How long have you been in Public Affairs at State?

BRYCE
Under the last three Presidents.

WILL
You worked for both parties.

BRYCE
You know the difference? Republicans want a huge military but they don't
want to send
it anywhere. The Democrats wants a small military and they want to send
it everywhere.

WILL
Yes, I've heard that.

BRYCE
Actually, when I heard the name Bailey, I got a chill in my occipital,
a Pavlovian
reaction from when I used to have run-ins with a General Tom Bailey at the
home store
in Brussels. Any relation?

WILL
A little bit. He's my father.

BRYCE
Really?

WILL
Yes, sir.

BRYCE
How long have you been with the NSC?

WILL
I'm not.

BRYCE
How long have you been White House Senior Staff?

WILL
Oh, no, I'm not that either. I'm on a three-week contract with the DNC to
work on the
Inauguration speech.

BRYCE
Son, I'm an Assistant Secretary.

WILL
For Public Affairs. Which makes you just the person I need to speak to. The
President
is troubled by some of the language...

BRYCE
Then this should been taken up between myself and Toby Zeigler.

WILL
I hope you don't mind. Toby's asked me to speak to you.

BRYCE
What are the concerns?

WILL
"America stands alone as the indispensable nation-- a force for peace,
freedom and
prosperity on all corners of the globe."

BRYCE
But that's almost exactly what we wrote.

WILL
No, that is exactly what you wrote. I'm quoting the State Department text.

BRYCE
You memorized it? It was 1,200 words.

WILL
I'm pretty sure it was 1,123.

BRYCE
What's his concern?

WILL
Well, I'm suppose to begin with-- and this neither here nor there-- but
globes don't
have corners.

BRYCE
If this is about style and not substance...

WILL
No, it's about substance.

BRYCE
We've been over this long before you got here, and I imagine we'll keep on
going over
it long after your three weeks are done. This White House has to be careful
about the
use of force. It's a hostile Congress.

WILL
Well, personally, I'd have no problem using force on Congress, but that's
not my call.

BRYCE
This President can't write himself a blank check when it comes to foreign
policy.
Especially this President.

WILL
Especially this President.

BRYCE
That's right.

WILL
Because of the Clause in Article One that says not every President gets
the full
powers of Commander-in-Chief?

BRYCE
Are you rewriting the section?

WILL
Yes, sir.

BRYCE
Dramatically?

WILL
Well, I like to think I have a certain flair.

BRYCE
I mean significantly.

WILL
That's what the President is looking for, sir.

BRYCE
In consultation with State?

WILL
That's entirely up to Toby.

BRYCE
Thank you, sir. [stands] Apparently, I'm not done with the Baileys.

Bryce Lilly exits.

WILL
Apparently not... you effete...

BANG! There's a loud thud on the window. Will gets up and sees Toby throwing
a ball
against the window that separates their offices. Will walks into TOBY'S OFFICE.

WILL
What are you doing?

TOBY
I throw a rubber ball against the window, that means you come to me.

WILL
Really?

TOBY
As my frustration level grows, so does the velocity of the ball against
the window.

WILL
I just told Bryce Lilly.

TOBY
Good.

WILL
[pointing to boxes piled on Toby's desk] What's in there?

TOBY
Did you ask for transcripts of public remarks from Manchester?

WILL
Yes.

TOBY
That's what they are.

WILL
Okay.

TOBY
And the 14 other cartoons outside.

WILL
Okay.

TOBY
So we're dumping State's language?

WILL
Yes.

TOBY
Which means we'll need some of our own.

WILL
Yes.

TOBY
I'm talking to myself right now, so there's no reason for you to be answering.

WILL
Is there a reason for me to be standing here?

TOBY
No.

WIll exits Toby's office. Toby starts to throw the ball at the window again
but stops.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is sitting in a chair reading. Charlie knocks and enters.

CHARLIE
Sir?

BARTLET
Yeah?

CHARLIE
Mr. Cravenly, the Director of Special Collections at the New Hampshire
Historical
Society, just phoned about the Bartlet Bible.

BARTLET
And?

CHARLIE
You can't use it.

BARTLET
I can't?

CHARLIE
It needs to be in a climate-controlled vault or it warps.

BARTLET
Just as the disciples intended.

CHARLIE
He suggested the Jefferson Bible.

BARTLET
The Jefferson bible doesn't warp?

CHARLIE
I think it does, and being from new Hampshire, he just didn't care.

BARTLET
Probably. Speaking of New Hampshire, don't I own the Bartlet Bible?

CHARLIE
It was sold at auction.

BARTLET
I know. I bought it.

CHARLIE
And you donated to the New Hampshire Historical Society.

BARTLET
And they won't loan it back to me so that I can be inaugurated?

CHARLIE
Mr. Cravenly felt bad about that.

BARTLET
Yeah. His name is really Mr. Cravenly? You're not making that up?

CHARLIE
No, sir. Bertram Cravenly.

BARTLET
Okay, would you tell him that I'd like very much to use my family's Bible,
which my
family has bought at least twice now.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You know, a couple hundred people got killed today in Khundu.

CHARLIE
Yeah, I saw, Mr. President.

BARTLET
The Arkutu control the government and they're killing...

CHARLIE
Yeah, I saw. The Americans got out?

BARTLET
I'm sorry?

CHARLIE
We got the Americans out?

BARTLET
Yeah, mm-hmm.

CHARLIE
Anything else, sir?

BARTLET
No.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir.

Charlie starts to walk out, but Bartlet calls back.

BARTLET
Yeah. Ask Bob Slattery to come over here.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BREIFING ROOM - DAY

C.J.
At that time, the Chief Justice will ask the President to raise his right
hand and
place his left hand on the Bible.

REPORTER MARK
C.J.?

C.J.
Yeah?

REPORTER MARK
And what will the President do then?

C.J.
Okay. Katie?

REPORTER KATIE
Will the President be asked to swear an oath of any kind?

C.J.
Well, I guess we'll find out six days from now, but thank you to the Smothers
Brothers.

Laughter.

C.J.
Good night.

REPORTERS
Thank you, C.J.

C.J. exits into the HALLWAY. Carol approaches C.J. and they do a walk-
and-talk.
C.J. doesn't notice that Danny is following behind them.

CAROL
C.J., Danny wanted to see you for a second.

C.J.
No way.

CAROL
Well...

C.J.
Stop trying to get us together, okay? If I wanted Danny, I could have
him. And he's
still a jackass from the foreign Ops vote and many other things, so tell
him I'm
getting my hair done.

DANNY
Your hair looks great.

C.J.
There was no way you could tell me he was right behind me? You couldn't fit
that in?

CAROL
Sorry.

C.J.
[to Danny] In here.

They go into C.J.'S OFFICE.

C.J.
Yes?

DANNY
My signal agent's missing, the cricket player.

C.J.
How...

DANNY
I tried his house. The phone's disconneted. The airstrip won't give me
information,
neither will the landlord, except he just signed a new two-year lease two
weeks ago.

C.J.
How do you know?

DANNY
Because I do.

C.J.
If I help you find the cricket player, you'll consider it a favor and not
the White
House cooperating with your story?

DANNY
I would never think the White House is cooperating with me.

C.J.
Thank you.

DANNY
Can I just ask? What is it you'd do exactly to have me?

C.J.
Is there anything else?

DANNY
No.

C.J.
Good.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet is at his desk reading. Charlie knocks and enters.

CHARLIE
Sir? Mr. Slattery.

BARTLET
Yeah.

BOB "BOBBY" SLATTERY [NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR]
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Bobby, what's going on?

BOB
Intelligence is thin outside Bitanga. In fact, the Archbishop's network
of clerics
is probably as good as it gets.

BARTLET
The Catholic Church has better intelligence than we do?

BOB
It's a very small embassy, maybe ten people. And no Agency presence.

BARTLET
None?

BOB
No, sir.

BARTLET
How many are dead right now?

BOB
We have no way of knowing.

BARTLET
Estimate.

BOB
Could be as many as 5,000.

BARTLET
Bobby, I don't want to make noise but I want to see a forced depletion report.
I want to know how many we'd lose and I want to do it without going three
rounds
in the newspaper with Miles Hutchison. Who do we have at the Pentagon who could
do this for us?

BOB
Jack Reese, Nancy's aid.

BARTLET
You trust him?

BOB
I do.

BARTLET
Tell him I want to see forced depletion on a peacekeeping force in Khundu. And
tell
him we'll do our best to keep it away from the Secretary's office.

BOB
He won't need to hear the second part, sir. You just gave him an order.

BARTLET
Thank you.

BOB
Thank you, Mr. President.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS BRIEFNG ROOM - DAY

	TUESDAY

C.J.
First things first. We're going to have to learn how to pronounce it. I
learned it
as "Kuhn-doo." The Republic of Equatorial Khundu.

REPORTER MARK
C.J.?

C.J.
Mark.

REPORTER MARK
There are reports that the Arkutu government issued identification tags.

C.J.
We don't know.

MARK
I mean, stating whether a Khundunese is Arkutu or Induye.

C.J.
We don't know. Danny?

DANNY
Archbishop Kintaka, who was coincidentally in the White House yesterday for a
prayer breakfast, said the government's using the radio to direct mobs. Does
the
White House know anything about that?

C.J.
Well, I don't.

DANNY
Apparently, one of the Bishop's had provided refuge to about 800 Induye in his
church. When the radio station in Bitanga heard about it, they directed a mob.
They had machetes, they sent them to the church...

C.J.
Did they...?

DANNY
They hacked up all 800.

C.J.
No, I didn't know that.

DANNY
Apparently, every broadcast ends with the word "Krawala."

C.J.
It means "cleanse."

DANNY
Yeah. So I guess my question is, is the President going to send U.S. troops in
to knock this off?

C.J.
The White House is monitering the situation very carefully.

DANNY
I can tell.

C.J.
Katie.

KATIE
State Department estimates yesterday put the dead at anywhere between 3,000 and
7,000. Are there revised estimates today?

C.J.
15,000. Sheila?

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
Josh has his feet proped up on the desk reading when Donna knocks on the
doorframe
and enters.

JOSH
Yep?

DONNA
What's up?

JOSH
Hmm?

DONNA
I just said, "What's up?" What are you doing?

JOSH
Wondering whether the Nuclear regulatory Commission really needs $100,000 for a
"morale improvement program." It's got to be a pretty critical lap dance.

DONNA
I went down to Jack's office last night and he was using the NSC lock on
the door,
which he never has before.

JOSH
Did you knock?

DONNA
Yeah.

JOSH
And?

DONNA
He let me in.

JOSH
That's a good story.

DONNA
I wanted to make plans for getting together around midnight, and he said
he couldn't
'cause it'll be morning where he needs to talk to some people.

JOSH
Donna...

DONNA
What's halfway around the world?

JOSH
Most of the homes and offices of the people who live on this planet.

DONNA
He had a fax from the Commader of the Seventh Fleet about forward units in
the North
Atlantic and Mediterranean.

JOSH
What's he doing showing you a fax from the Commander of the Seventh Fleet?

DONNA
Showing off for me.

JOSH
Fantastic.

DONNA
He wasn't showing me a classified signal intercept.

JOSH
How do you know what he was showing you?

DONNA
I don't. He does. Is a joint task force being assembled...

JOSH
Are you serious with these questions?

DONNA
He's been sealed off for almost 24 hours, and everything strikes me as strange.

JOSH
Then let it strike you that way, and please find out what they mean by "morale
improvement program" so I can get back to-- you know-- actual people.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Charlie is at Bartlet desks fixing papers, when Bartlet enters from the
portico.

BARTLET
Hey, I changed my mind about the Bible.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I don't know. I never... it just seems parochial. I hate saying that.

CHARLIE
I understand.

BARTLET
There's a Bible in North Hampton, Masachusetts, that Johnathon Edwards
used. Let's
get that.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Leo enters from his office. Charlie exits.

LEO
Good morining, Mr. President.

BARTLET
"Grace is but glory begun and glory is but grace perfected." I made my
Bible selection.

LEO
Listen to this, please. The Supreme Court is striking down the use of prior
offenses
as a factor in Stiles v. Rhode Island. The Chief Justice writes a concurring
opinion:
"Guilty or not guilty, past convictions frustrate the judge who wonders
should your
fate abate."

BARTLET
It's awkwardly worded.

LEO
No, it's not. it's 22 syllables.

BARTLET
Oh, God.

LEO
Two, four, six, eight. Two. And it's suppose to sound like this: "Guilty,
or not
guilty, past convictions frustrate, the judge who wonders should your fate,
abate."
It's a cinquain.

BARTLET
A what?

LEO
Cinquain.

BARTLET
How do you know?

LEO
I know things. And I'm worried about the Chief Justice.

BARTLET
And I'm worried about the White House making that suggestion.

LEO
He's writing in verse, plus the powdered wigs.

BARTLET
Wasn't that a rumor?

LEO
Yes.

BARTLET
All right, listen. I've asked for a forced depletion report on action
in Khundu.

LEO
Who'd you ask?

BARTLET
Slatterly got Jack Reese.

LEO
What'd it say?

BARTLET
The best scenario is that simply by engaging, the Arkutu lay down their
weapons,
but that doesn't seem likey, so we'd lose people.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
More if they go into the countryside.

LEO
What do you expect?

BARTLET
Yeah.

LEO
Toby's working on new policy language.

BARTLET
I'm sorry?

LEO
I say Toby's working on new foreign policy language.

BARTLET
Good.

LEO
Can I see the report?

BARTLET
You should.

Bartlet hands the report to Leo.

LEO
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. WILL'S OFFICE - DAY
Will is talking to his sister Elsie who is sitting on a table.

WILL
He led an unsuccessful court case to block all federal death penalties
as violating
the Equal Protection Clause.

ELSIE
Why?

WILL
'Cause ferdal law applies to almost nowhere but Indian reservations.

ELSIE
Hmm.

WILL
This is the best. Congress will never create real campaign reform because
they're the
ones who have to run in elections, so he proposed legislation that would
grandfather
it in 30 years.

Toby enters.

TOBY
What are you doing?

WILL
Familiarizing myself with his tone.

TOBY
You're not thinking about policy language?

WILL
I'm doing both.

TOBY
Because we have five days.

ELSIE
He knows, and I can confirm that he's thinking and familiaring himself
simultaneously.

TOBY
You really comfortable going through life with a name like Elsie Snuffin?

ELSIE
I've never been comforable, but I'm not sure it's because of my name.

TOBY
Well, the idea isn't going to walk in here and announce itself as being
important
and take a place on the top of the pile.

WILL
I understand.

INTERN STACY
Excuse me, Will. This is from the Congressional Reasearch Service. It's an old
Bartlet speech on foreign policy.

WILL
Why wasn't it in the original?

STACY
It was stricken from the Congressional Record at the Presidents request. Should
I
place it here on top of this pile?

WILL
No, I'll take that.

Will takes the speech from Stacy. He looks up at Toby who smiles.

TOBY
Yeah.

Toby exits. Will sits down, opens the speech and begins to read.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO
* * *

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. TOBY'S OFFICE - DAY
Will is reading Toby passages from the speech that Stacy dropped off to
him. Elsie
is also in the room.

WILL
"America needs a new doctrine for a new century..."

TOBY
Mr. Bailey...

WILL
"...based not just on our interest, but on our values, across the world."

TOBY
Define those values for me, please.

WILL
I don't have to. The President of the United States already has. "We are
for freedom
of speech everywhere. Freedom to worship everywhere. Freedom to learn for
every child."

TOBY
Just out of curiosity, how are you going to enforce a universal global right to
education?

ELSIE
The same way the U.S. enforced anything it wanted in the middle part of
the 20th
century. Somebody called our father.

TOBY
What exactly are you doing here, anyway?

ELSIE
The First Lady likes my jokes.

TOBY
Excellent.

WILL
"It is our duty to give more than merely our support. We must give our strength
diplomatically, materially....

WILL and TOBY
"And if need be, militarily."

TOBY
I read it, I think, 16 years ago. It was about El Salvador and he had
it stricken
from the record and there was a reason.

WILL
What?

TOBY
I don't know, but things have reasons.

WILL
Do they?

TOBY
Yes, they do.

WILL
Okay, but C.J. this morning put the body count at 15,000.

TOBY
You're talking about Khundu? That's what the hell this is about?

WILL
We're talking about everything. "And freedom from the tyranny of oppression,
economic
slavery, religious fanaticism." Tell me if any of these describe anyone
we know.

TOBY
This isn't what I meat by drafting new language.

WILL
What did you mean?

TOBY
Making the old language sound better. You're asking the two of us to create
foreign
policy by ourselves. That's usually not a good idea. You've got your
Pentagon, the
NSC and-- what do you call it?-- the State Department.

WILL
You and Leo McGarry and Josh are his senior counselors and it's not like
he doesn't
already want to go there.

TOBY
This language proposes a new doctrine for the use of force. That we use force
whenever we see an injustice we want to correct. Like Mother Theresa with
first-strike capabilities.

WILL
Damn right.

TOBY
Oh, you've had too many dinners with daddy. Please go back to finding new
language
for the foreign section!

WILL
Yeah, I should.

Will starts to walk out, but turns back around.

WILL
I'm only working here another four days.

TOBY
But what?

WILL
He'd do a radio address proposing free liposuction to every child of woman born
if you wrote it for him.

TOBY
You're wrong. And if he did, I'd be fired shortly thereafter.

WILL
Maybe, but ten pounds lighter.

Will walks out. Elsie remains in his office and Toby looks at her.

TOBY
[to Elsie] You go back to doing whatever it is you do.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY

	WEDNESDAY

Charlie is escorting a group of people into the West Wing. They are carrying a
table that has something on it, but it's covered with a red cloth.

CHARLIE
We'll bring it to the Blue Room and let the President look at it there.

ADAM KENT
Very well.

Bartlet comes walking into the Lobby and spots Charlie.

BARTLET
Hey, is this it?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. This is Adam Kent from the Johnathon Edwards Historical Foundation.

BARTLET
Good to meet you.

ADAM
But we've meet before.

BARTLET
Of course.

ADAM
And this, sir, is the John Edwards Bible.

Adam pulls back the red cloth revealing an extremely large bible.

BARTLET
This?

ADAM
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
It's huge.

ADAM
Well, it ought to be.

BARTLET
Actually, it can't be.

ADAM
It's a pullpit folio, obviously from a time when portability was not an
issue and
illuminations add pages as well as heft. Also, it's written in four languages.

BARTLET
The First Lady has to hold this in her hand. This one's going to take the
First Lady,
the Chief Justice and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

ADAM
Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and English.

BARTLET
Okay... Mr. Carlton?

ADAM
Kent.

BARTLET
Sorry. Thanks. Charlie's going to take care of you. [to Charlie] Charlie,
that Bible's
the size of a Volkswagon. Can we get the Washington Bible?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thank you.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

DIRECTOR 1
At 900 hours we're running the field tests of the next generation predator.
Specifically, that's the new night vision capabilities at Camp Red Cloud in
Uijongbu City.

LEO
Okay. Europe?

DIRECTOR 2
INTEL's reporting potential Basque terrorist plots in Spain.

LEO
State's going to issue an alert?

DIRECTOR 2
Yeah, and DCI's liaising with Guradi Civil.

DIRECTOR 3
And there's a border dispute between Lithuania and Belarus.

LEO
Okay, thanks.

They all get up to exit.

LEO
Miles? [waits for everyone to exit] What's the general thinking in Khundu?

MILES HUTCHINSON
That we should support all the international diplomatic efforts to.... You
know the
U.N.'s already made overtures to the Arkutu.

LEO
That's what's happening at the State Department. I want to know what's
happening
at Central Command.

HUTCHINSON
If you mean militarily, we're going to want to supply the bordering countries.

LEO
That's not what I mean. We're getting INTEL that isn't making it onto CNN, but
that's a matter of a couple of hours. Truly horrible accounts of mass
slaughtering...

HUTCHINSON
Leo...

LEO
...that should make us at least want to investigate whether there's a genocide.

HUTCHINSON
Lee lost 10,000 at Gettysberg, didn't make it genocide.

LEO
Okay, so I'll go to the President with it.

HUTCHINSON
In our case, we'd lose closer to a thousand, which is pretty
stupid. Magnificently
so when we realize we're talking about a guy who's never led an army.

LEO
A] The guy is the President. B] He's been leading one for 3 years, 51 weeks and
three days. How much more training would you like him to have? And C] It's
not a
thousand. We saw a forced depletion report, it's 150.

HUTCHINSON
You saw a forced depletion report?

LEO
Yes.

HUTCHINSON
How did he see a forced depletion report?

LEO
Look, from time to time, just to expedite things, Nancy will print...

HUTCHINSON
Nancy's out of the country. It was a raid.

LEO
The guy was following a direct order.

HUTCHINSON
I have no doubt he was. That's my problem, Leo.

LEO
I don't give a damn what....

HUTCHINSON
What?

LEO
I said I don't give a damn what your problem is, Miles. The man wants to
know if he
sends troops, how many are going to die.

HUTCHINSON
And if he wants to see forced depletion, he asks me.

LEO
He asks you and three days mange to go by before he sees it, Mr. Secretary. Yet
miraculously, the Wall Street Journal, on day two, the numbers inflated all
to hell.
It's 150, not a thousand.

HUTCHINSON
And that's accecptable to you in Khundu?

LEO
I don't know what you mean when you say "in Khundu." Nah... yeah, I do.

HUTCHINSON
Go to hell.

LEO
Okay.

Hutchinson exits. Leo gathers up his papers and out of frustration throws
them down
on the desk knocking over a glass of water. He throws his hands up then
picks up the
now empty glass.

CUT TO: INT. WILL'S OFFICE - DAY
Will is sitting at his desk. Bartlet enters and knocks on the doorframe.

WILL
[not looking up] Keep your pants on, Toby, I'm almost there.

BARTLET
Toby been taking his pants off again? That's just something he does.

WILL
[looks up, then stands] Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
How's it going?

WILL
Fine, sir.

BARTLET
Good.

WILL
No, it's not.

BARTLET
Yeah. What's hard is that foreign policy has become a statement of what we
won't do.

WILL
Yes, sir.

Bartlet picks up the speech off of Will's desk.

BARTLET
"A new doctrine for a new century, based not just on our interests, but on our
values across the world." Well, that's pretty spicey stuff.

WILL
You wrote it, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah, I know. Why is a Khundunese life worth less to me than an American life?

WILL
I don't know, sir, but it is.

BARTLET
That was ballsy.

WILL
I won't be working here long.

BARTLET
You Tom Bailey's son?

WILL
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Talk about the very model of a modern Major General.

WILL
Yes, sir.

Bartlet exits.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. is in her office. Carol can be heard over the PA system.

CAROL [on PA]
Ladies and genlemen, the briefing's about to begin. Please take your seats, the
briefing's about to begin.

C.J. walks into the HALLWAY where Danny calls out ot her.

DANNY
C.J....

C.J.
I found your ramp signal agent.

DANNY
Me too. He took a job in an airport in the Cooperatve Republic of
Guyana. That's
where you're sending people?

C.J.
We don't send anyone anywhere who doesn't work for us, but I understand
he's gotten
a salary-bump and he's co-captian of a local cricket team.

DANNY
I called him.

C.J.
And?

DANNY
He doesn't remember me. Then he does, but he doesn't remember anything about an
airstrip. He does, but he doesn't remember anything about not getting in.

C.J.
Mystery solved.

DANNY
C.J.

C.J.
Come here.

C.J takes Danny into what looks like a COPIER ROOM and closes the door.

C.J.
This is ridiculous. It's been ridiculous ever since you came back.

DANNY
What?

C.J.
Would you mind if I turned out the lights?

DANNY
No.

C.J. turns off the lights.

C.J.
It's just easier this way. For three years I have been thinking about
what might
have been if it weren't....

DANNY
Yeah?

C.J.
...for the conflict.

DANNY
Yeah?

C.J.
And I'm almost over it. I mean, I am right there and you come back with
scruffy face
and your jokes and your incredible talent and your way of getting at... getting
at me.
And I was thinking if we could...

DANNY
Be adult?

C.J. runs her wrist by Danny's nose.

C.J.
Do you like this perfume?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
Do you like this blouse?

DANNY
What's gotten into you?

She opens her blouse a little bit.

C.J.
Do you?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
Come here.

Danny's hesitant at first, but he gives in and comes to her. He leans in and is
about to kiss her when C.J. interrupts.

C.J.
Remember when you asked me what exactly I'd do to have you?

By now, C.J. is right up against Danny with her hands stroking up and down
his chest.
She's has his face in her hands as if she's about to kiss him.

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
I'd do that.

C.J. grabs her folder and walks out of the room leaving Danny standing there.

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
C.J. is about to walk in the PRESS ROOM when a man walks up to her and hands
her a
piece of paper.

C.J.
Good evening. I have revised estimates for Khundu. We said 15,000 yesterday.
Intelligence reports are putting it closer to 25... 25,000.

The reporters start to shout out C.J.'s name.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
The TV is tuned to the breifing bring held.

C.J. [on TV] Mark?

REPORTER MARK [on TV]
Is the White House being careful not to call this a genocide?

Josh walks into the room where Charlie is reading papers.

JOSH
Hey.

CHARLIE
Hey.

JOSH
He in?

CHARLIE
In a minute. He's got a security briefing.

JOSH
What's that?

CHARLIE
It's a seating chart for the Inauguration.

JOSH
You're sitting with us in the staff section.

CHARLIE
Yeah, I'm looking for someone else.

JOSH
Would it be weird if I just walked around with a military dress saber?

CHARLIE
Mm-hmm.

JOSH
Okay. He's in a security briefing?

CHARLIE
I'll let him know you're here.

JOSH
Navy dress uniform has 13 buttons on the pants. I mean, traditions tradition,
but
I'd be concerned about the level of bladder discipline that requires,
wouldn't you?

CHARLIE
What?

JOSH
Nothing.

Charlie puts on his jacket and goes to get Bartlet.

CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSELVELT ROOM - DAY
Bartlet and various other Directors are in the room holding a meeting.

MAN 1
King Nawa of Bhutan died.

BARTLET
We'll send condolences. What's next?

MAN 1
The new king is Yeshey Pradhan Nawa.

BARTLET
Okay.

MAN 1
He's 13 years old.

BARTLET
Well, if he's old enough to marry Jerry Lee Lewis, I guess he's old enough
to be
king of Bhutan. What's next?

CLARK
A detained ship 12 miles of the Port of Miami; Nigerian flag.

BARTLET
Coast Guards got it?

CLARK
Yes, sir.

MAN 3
The joint training exercise has been cleared for the Black Sea and the Caspian.
This is actually...

BARTLET
What's happening? I'm sorry, what's happening in the REK?

MAN 1
The General Assembly's debating a proclamation.

BARTLET
Well, a proclamation ought to do the trick. What's the CIA know that I
should know?

CLARK
Neighbors are... swapping family members.

BARTLET
All right, thank you.

ALL
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President.

CHARLIE
You wanted Josh?

BARTLET
Yeah. Hey, I changed my mind. Not the Washington Bible.

They walk by the HALLWAY.

CHARLIE
You sure?

BARTLET
Yeah.

CHARLIE
I'm only asking 'cause they need some notice on the Washington Bible.

BARTLET
Yeah, I'm going to use my father's.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet knocks on Leo's door. Leo is sitting at his desk reading.

LEO
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Did you talk to Hutchinson?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
[to Charlie] Tell Josh I'll just be a minute, okay?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

Bartlet enters LEO'S OFFICE and closes the door.

BARTLET
Did he tell me to shut up and let him run the Pentagon?

LEO
In so many words.

BARTLET
How many?

LEO
Not that many. As a matter of fact, we didn't get that far. I got Jack Reese in
some trouble.

BARTLET
So Hutchinson know I've seen forced depletion.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
He should be pissed at me, not Jack Reese.

LEO
He should be pissed at you? The Secretary of Defense should be pissed at...

BARTLET
Don't worry about it. Right?

LEO
Sure. No problem.

BARTLET
Don't worry about it.

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Clark says neighbors are swapping family members in Khundu.

LEO
Really?

BARTLET
Also, there's a new king of Bhutan. And he's been bar mitzvaed and everything.

LEO
All right.

BARTLET
Hey, this guy you hired for the Inauguration speech gave me a little back
chat a
few minutes ago.

LEO
Bailey?

BARTLET
Yeah, he was using a floor speech about El Salvador I gave 98 years ago
to demonstrate
that the U.S. should send troops to Khundu. Rhetorically, I said, "Why is
a Khundunese
life worth less to me than an American life?" And he said, "I dont know,
sir, but it is."

LEO
I'll try to get some better information.

BARTLET
Thank you.

LEO
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet enters THE OVAL OFFICE through Leo's office and Josh is sitting in
a chair
waiting for him.

JOSH
Good evening, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hey, Josh. There's intelligence that Khundunese neighbors in the country
are swapping
family members.

JOSH
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

BARTLET
For the night, they're swapping family members you know, and sleeping in
each other's
houses.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
What's going on?

JOSH
You know what, nothing I can't deal with.

BARTLET
State?

JOSH
I did just get off the phone with Jeffrey Tomlinson and Bob Bibbet.

BARTLET
Tell them...

JOSH
They're under... I'm sorry, sir, they're under the impression that the entire
foreign policy section is being rewritten.

BARTLET
It's not.

JOSH
I know, they just... asked me to emphasize that the current language has
been vetted
with the ranking members of House Armed Services.

BARTLET
The language is being polished.

JOSH
That's what I told them. They just asked me to remind you that their
version also
reflects existing treaties some of which....

BARTLET
Some of which have my name on them. So tell Jeff Tomlison and baby Bob to
take a
deep knee bend, would you? I'm just as big a cotton candy ass as they are.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
You're just going to let that hang in the air?

JOSH
Of course not, sir. You're a much bigger cotton candy ass than they are.

BARTLET
Damn right.

JOSH
Anything else?

BARTLET
No.

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President.

Josh exits the Oval Office into the OUTER OVAL OFFICE where Donna is waiting.

JOSH
What's going on?

DONNA
I don't know what's going on, but Jack's been reassigned.

They walk to the HALLWAY.

JOSH
To where?

DONNA
Aviano.

JOSH
Air Force Base?

DONNA
Yes. Aviano Air Force Base.

JOSH
When?

DONNA
He got his orders.

JOSH
What happened?

DONNA
I don't know. He said he was asked to do something, he did it, he got a slap
on the
wrist and wouldn't tell me more than that.

JOSH
The reality of the fast-track Navy guys is they're going to bop around the
globe a lot.

DONNA
He was here less then three months, plus he said something happened.

JOSH
You can't begin to concieve of the internal politics of the Pentagon. Right
now,
Hutchinson and his boys...

They reach JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

DONNA
But he worked here. This is internal politics of the White House.

JOSH
Well, no one's told me about it and I'm not going to ask.

DONNA
He said he was asked to do something for somebody. It can only be Nancy, Leo or
the President.

JOSH
Three doors you definitely want to knock on to complain about your boyfriend
being
transferred to the Italian Alps.

DONNA
Hey, I'm not Gidget, okay? Something...

JOSH
Is he complaining?

DONNA
He doesn't complain.

JOSH
I ask you that because sometimes people request transfers.

DONNA
Somebody asked him to do something and he did it. I take him at his word,
as should
you, there being no reason not to. Is there anything you need?

JOSH
No.

DONNA
Thank you, sir.

Charlie walks up as Donna storms off.

JOSH
Jack Reese got transfered.

CHARLIE
Well, I've got my own Beach Boys song going.

They walk inside JOSH'S OFFICE.

JOSH
If you tell me you got a crush on Reese...

CHARLIE
Jean-Pierre is sitting next to her in the friends and family section.

JOSH
Zoey's lover?

CHARLIE
It's important that you call him that?

JOSH
Isn't his name Jean-Paul?

CHARLIE
Are we going to be together on this?

JOSH
Yes.

CHARLIE
Okay.

They both look a footage on the TV about Khundu. You see people marching
and armed
jeeps riding through the streets.

JOSH
Intelligence says neighbors in Khundu are sleeping in each others houses.

CHARLIE
What does that mena?

JOSH
It means they're making people in the same house rape each other on the promise
their lives will be spared.

CHARLIE
Okay. Do you need anything?

JOSH
Nah.

Charlie walks out as we pan down to the TV where footage of a slain child
is lying in
the streets. We then see footage of hundreds of dead bodies piled up on top
of each
other in a heap. Josh shuts off the TV.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
