TEASER

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Fitzwallace, Leo and Bartlet are in the Situation Room listening to GENERAL
JIMMY
WENDALL on a screen giving them an update on Kuhndu.

GENERAL JIMMY WENDALL
[on screen] ... consisting of the USS Harpers Ferry, the USS Cleveland,
the LHD-4
Boxer, sixteen light armored vehicles, four M-1A1 Main Battle Tanks, four
cobras
and eight Harriers.

FITZWALLACE
What about the 82nd? It's Fitz, General.

WENDALL
The 82nd began their drop 75 minutes ago. Now they're in the process of...

Someone comes and whispers something in his ear.

WENDALL
Excuse me, Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, for jut a moment.

Wendall goes and picks up a telephone behind him and talks.

BARTLET
I don't understand, did we just get put on call waiting or something?

FITZWALLACE
He's probably taking a call from Captain Morita on the Tallahassee.

BARTLET
Wendall's answering the phones at U.S. European Commamnd?

LEO
Would you take it easy?

BARTLET
Is he placing a bet?

FITZWALLACE
Are we allowed to do that? And can I make a quick phone call before the
101st Air
Assault...

WENDALL
Excuse me, Mr. President.

FITZWALLACE
Jimmy, was that Morita?

WENDALL
Yes, sir.

FITZWALLACE
What happened?

WENDALL
The 82nd's completed its takeover of Bitanga Airport, Admiral, that's what
happened.

Everyone in the Situation Room begins to clap and celebrate.

FITZWALLACE
Clear the 101st for the Bitanga Airport and stand by for a coded command,
General.

WENDALL
Yes, sir.

FITZWALLACE
[to Bartlet] Thank you, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Thank you.

ALL
Thank you, Mr. President.

Bartlet and Leo exit the Sit Room.
CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT HALLYWAY- CONTINUOUS

LEO
That was impressive.

BARTLET
Me?

LEO
No, them. I meant...

BARTLET
I get it.

LEO
I'm saying...

BARTLET
And I agree with you.

LEO
I'm not saying I don't think you can be impressive in the Situation Room.

BARTLET
I can tell by the way you laughed in my face at the suggestion that I was.

LEO
We changed wheels-up to 6:00 p.m.

BARTLET
I heard that. Why?

LEO
D-triple-C put an event in Brentwood.

BARTLET
I've told him over and over about money and endorsements from outside the
district.
Why is he going to Brentwood?

LEO
For the same reason Willy Sutton robbed banks.

BARTLET
What does Joey say?

LEO
He's anywhere from five to eight points down, favorabilty below 50. They're
making it
about values.

BARTLET
The right to privacy's a value, so is clean air.

LEO
That argument's been incredibly effective in the past.

BARTLET
OMB?

LEO
They want a few more hours for the revenue calculations, but they're saying
it's
definitely going to be today.

BARTLET
Deficit-nuetral, we've had 14 meetings.

LEO
They understand. Ways and Means Democrats, then the NEC breifing on scoring.

BARTLET
What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup? Scoring.

LEO
I know what you were saying. What, are you from the Ozarks?

BARTLET
Is there going to be a democrat tax plan, or am I going to be stuck in NEC
scoring
hell for the rest of my term?

LEO
You got a meeting on salmon runs in Oregon at 3:00.

BARTLET
What do salmon runs have to do with it?

LEO
Nothing, sir. It doesn't have anything to do with the tax plan. I was moving
on.

BARTLET
Last week it was a banana embargo. Is Congress opening a restaurant?

LEO
There's no reason you can't relax a little bit in California.

BARTLET
Aren't there quite a few reasons?

LEO
Yes.

They finally enter the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

DEBBIE
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Miss Humentashen.

DEBBIE
Isn't it a little early in the day, sir?

BARTLET
Leo said just now that there was going to be an NEC briefing on scoring and
tell her
what I said.

LEO
"What's wrong with booze and a comfortable pickup?"

DEBBIE
No, I see there's no hour too early for your Noel Cowardesque wit, sir.

BARTLET
No there's not.

DEBBIE
Ambassador Tiki is in the Oval Office, sir.

Bartlet enters THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I was just in the White House
Situation Room.

AMBASSADOR TIKI
Mr. President, the U.S. is trampling on the sovereignty of my country and
on behalf of
Nzele...

BARTLET
I've just taken your airport... [shakes his hand] ...clearing the way for
the 101st Air
Assualt to take the capitol. 7,000 troops, 25 battle tanks, 15 Apache attack
helicopters,
and three destroyers. Strictly speaking, I conquered your country without
the paperwork.

TIKI'S AIDE
Kuhndu is in the midst of a civil war.

BARTLET
No, it's not. It's in the midst of a one-sided slaughtering of an entire
people. Both
the Secretary General of the United Nations and the Vatican have pleaded
with President
Nzele for a cease-fire and both the U.N. and the Holy Father have struck
out to the peril
of 115,000 Induye men, women, and God knows children, particularly the boys.

TIKI
Who will soon be men and will rise up...

BARTLET
The heads of Ghana, Nigeria and Zaire have similairly sent packing. The Red
Cross has been
denied entry on three seperate occasions in the last ten says. President
Nzele has 36 hours
to give the command to his troops to hand over their weapons to the 82nd
Divison Airborne
Division of the United States Army. At 36 hours and one minute, I give the
order for the
101st Air Assualt to take Bitanga and run up our flag. I skipped
breakfast. Anybody want
coffee or something?

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

C.J.
The President informed both Ambassador Tiki and President Nzele that they
have 36-- now
34 and a half hours-- to implement a halt to the violence before U.S. forces
deploy. John.

REPORTER JOHN
And that would consist of what?

C.J.
You've got a Pentagon briefing at noon. Katie.

REPORTER KATIE
Are we in direct talks with Nzele?

C.J.
The government of Ghana as offered to act as an intermediary, and those
talks begin
within the hour.

REPORTER STEVE
Does the military operation have a name?

C.J.
Safe Haven.

REPORTER MARK
Have you decided on a press policy?

C.J.
Always be upbeat.

REPORTER MARK
Right. I meant...

C.J.
Yeah, I don't get to decide press policy for the U.S. Armed Forces, though
if wishing
made it so, but we're bring Pentagon Public Affairs on the California trip
and we'll
be meeting about it all weekend. Tonights forecast for D.C. is 18 degrees
of Mercury.
For Newport Beach, it's 78 and sunny.

REPORTER KATIE
At night?

C.J.
Even at night.

REPORTER STEVE
What kind of a reception are you expecting?

C.J.
Well, Sam's going to meet us and we're going to get something to eat.

REPORTER STEVE
I meant by Orange County.

C.J.
Don't be fooled. They love us in Orange County. They're crazy-go-nuts for
the President.
They're really the Democratic party in general. I think they really like it
when we come
to town. When we were there last month, we we're working the crowd, and some
boys,
worried possibly that I couldn't afford fruits and vegetables on a government
salary,
tossed me some of their own.

The reporters laugh.

C.J.
78 and sunny. Yeah, we're going to have a dabba-doo time, so unless there
are any
updates, I'll see you on the plane.

REPORTERS
Thank you, C.J.

C.J. exits to the HALLWAY.

C.J.
[to Carol] I've got $1,331 in my checking account. I'll write you a check
for $1,300
if you go to California instead of me. Just leave me $31 for food and
transportation.

CAROL
Gretchen Olan's been bumped from "Meet The Press."

C.J.
That, by the way, was a sky-blue DKNY suit worn for 41 minutes. There should
be a law
against that.

CAROL
There is a law against that.

C.J.
Who was she bumped for?

CAROL
Rittenhouse.

C.J.
Okay.

CAROL
And "This Week" wants to reschedule the Attorney General.

They reach C.J.'S OFFICE.

C.J.
For who?

CAROL
Gacey, I think. Um...

C.J.
All right, let's see if we can get Gretchen in front of the Times and...

CAROL
The HHS...

C.J.
Wait a second. Rittenhouse and Gacey?

CAROL
Yeah.

C.J.
It's the tax plan. Josh!

C.J. goes to JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA.

C.J.
[to Josh] Rittenhouse and Gacey just booked the Sunday shows. [to Carol]
We need to
see the President.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Bartlet, Jean-Paul and Zoey are in the Oval Office. Bartlet is somewhat
annoyed with
Jean-Paul.

JEAN-PAUL
It is better to work to live, I think, than to live to work.

BARTLET
Right. On the other hand, 20% of your youth is unemployed. They're just
living to live.

JEAN-PAUL
Yes, that is right, but sir, we have the best public health care and pension
in the
world. State-financed pensions are equal almost income levels.

BARTLET
Yeah, it helps when someone else is picking up the bigger ticket items like
a national
defense.

ZOEY
I love seeing my two men sparring.

BARTLET
I'm sorry?

JEAN-PAUL
She's very fond of you.

BARTLET
Excellent.

Charlie knocks and enters.

CHARLIE
Sir?

BARTLET
Yes, absolutely, send them in.

JEAN-PAUL
You see, there is an attitude in your culture. There is an effort to defy
all that is
European and that behavior is seen by many to be...

Josh, Toby, C.J. and Will enter.

BARTLET
Yeah, whatever, hang on a second. [to Josh] What do you need?

JOSH
Sir, we didn't know you were busy; we'll wait outside.

BARTLET
No, that's all right. What do you need?

JOSH
The three of you should bond.

BARTLET
Come here.

Bartlet walks over yo Josh and whispers in his ear.

BARTLET
If you leave, I'll kill you.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
I'm sorry, Jean-Paul, I'll have to cut it short. Josh has gotten himself in
a jam. But
I'll see you on the plane tonight, and I'll look forward to continue the
discussion on,
you know, what's wrong with me.

JEAN-PAUL
Yes.

ZOEY
Bye dad. See you guys.

Jean-Paul and Zoey exit.

BARTLET
What?

C.J.
The chair of House Ways and Means and Senate Finance are doing the Sunday
shows.

BARTLET
You think the Republicans are rolling out their tax plan?

C.J.
I do.

BARTLET
Thank God.

C.J.
Why?

BARTLET
'Cause we can roll out ours and I don't have to sit through another seven
scoring meetings.

JOSH
But it means they're going to announce their tax plan this afternoon or this
evening.
That's tomorrow and Sunday before we respond.

BARTLET
Why not respond Saturday or Sunday? Better yet, let's go first. Call the
press in, and
I'll do it right now.

JOSH
It's not ready yet. It's still being scored.

BARTLET
Toby?

TOBY
I don't like that French kid very much.

BARTLET
It'll be ready tomorrow?

TOBY
Yes.

BARTLET
I say we respond to theirs with ours, but we do it tomorrow or Sunday.

TOBY
You'd be announcing a one-percent tax increase on the richest one percent
and doing it
in Orange County.

BARTLET
Then that's where we do it.

WILL
Except, Mr. President, it'll kill Sam. It'll kill him in the 47th. It may
be seen as
gutsy by the rest of the country, but you'll kill Sam's campaign.

JOSH
Which is why I think we should cancel the trip.

BARTLET
And announce from the White House.

JOSH
Yes, sir.

C.J.
Won't the White House canceling the trip be taken as a signal that we've
given up on
the 47th?

WILL
Yes.

C.J.
And do equal damage to the campaign?

WILL
Yeah.

JOSH
You want to go to Orange County?

C.J.
I think we have to go. [to Bartlet] Even though there's $1,300 with your
name on it if
you don't make me go with you.

TOBY
Get over the dress, would you?

C.J.
It was a suit and they hit me with an avocado.

TOBY
It could've been worse.

C.J.
How?

TOBY
They could have hit me.

C.J.
Sir, the first 24 hours of the cycle are critical. We can't fight something
with nothing
and that's what we'll have for 48 hours after they announce if we don't
announce too.

BARTLET
That's a killer decision. But let's lean towards Sam and say we keep our
mouths shut in
California and then come out fighting Monday morning.

JOSH
Thank you, Mr. President.

C.J., TOBY and WILL
Thank you, sir.

We follow the staff to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE, then to the HALLWAY.

C.J.
[to Toby] I'm going to go pack 38 sets of clothes now for two days. [leaves]

TOBY
Will?

WILL
Yeah?

TOBY
Every speech the President gives on Tuesday has to be about the Democratic
tax plan.
How many public remarks is he making on Tuesday?

WILL
Nine.

TOBY
Plus we need speech inserts for the Cabinet.

WILL
I can get it done by Tuesday.

They enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

TOBY
Yes, you can, because you're going to use the staff to help you.

WILL
Which staff?

TOBY
Your staff-- the White House speechwriting staff. Your staff. You will tell
them what you
need. You will expect it. You will tell them how they can do better, and
they will do it.

WILL
Yes.

TOBY
Yes.

They enter TOBY'S OFFICE.

WILL
In theory.

TOBY
Yes.

WILL
On paper, your plan is very sound.

TOBY
But in reality?

WILL
I don't think they like me very much.

TOBY
No, no, no, they don't like you at all.

WILL
Why? Why, oh, why is that true? What have I done?

TOBY
Don't know; more to the point, I don't care.

WILL
I made Rice Krispies Treats.

TOBY
They've been working for the President forever. You've been here three minutes,
and
he made you a deputy. They have whiplash.

WILL
And understanding that, I brought in Rice Krispies Treats.

TOBY
And I'm surprised they haven't come around yet.

WILL
I can get it done myself.

TOBY
Listen to me. Many of these are the lowest possible priority remarks. There
are more
valuable places for your time. Now instruct your staff.

WILL
Yes.

Will leaves Toby's office.

WILL
Excuse me, Ginger?

GINGER
Yes?

WILL
Are you, by any chance, on my staff?

GINGER
I'm one of your staff assistants.

WILL
Great. Would you call a meeting of the speechwriting staff for this evening?

GINGER
Are you going to be there?

WILL
Yeah... yes! Yes, the meetings with me.

GINGER
Yes, sir.

WILL
Thanks.

Will walks into his OFFICE. He turns around and is about to say something
but goes into
his office and closes the door. He picks up the phone and dials.

SAM
[on phone] Hello?

WILL
Hey, it's Will.

SAM
How you doing?

WILL
Why did you cancel the Teamsters?

SAM
Scott thought we should be at the Manufacturing Association breakfast.

WILL
I don't think that was very smart.

SAM
[to Scott] Hey, Scott, Will says he doesn't think you're very smart.

WILL
I said it wasn't smart.

SAM
What do you need?

WILL
I'm just calling to say hi.

SAM
Really?

WILL
How do I get the speechwriting staff to like me?

SAM
I don't know, but when you do, why don't you tell me how you did it?

WILL
They didn't get along with you?

SAM
You're going to have some new staffers in there.

WILL
Yeah, but the problem is they're a lot of remarks we have to get ready for
Monday.

SAM
What's going on Monday?

WILL
[beat] The environment. It's a whole thing about the environment.

CUT TO: SAM'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

AIDE 1
Sam?

SAM
[to Will] Got to go.

WILL
Okay.

They hang up.

SAM
[to Scott] He was wondering why we canceled the Teamsters.

SCOTT HOLCOMB
Sam, while they're here this weekend, you're going to need to work at avoiding
the
appearance you're sitting in his lap, he's reading you a bedtime story.

SAM
I'm going to need to work hard to avoid that appearance?

SCOTT
Yeah, you are.

SAM
Well, let me ask you, what do we have planned that might be mistaken...

SCOTT
You stand next to him, you're aid-de-camp. You're a waterboy.

AIDE 1
Second banana.

SAM
Did you not think I knew what he meant?

SCOTT
This went fast in an ugly directon. The better point is people need to know
you're
independent.

SAM
Well, I have a good feeling about this trip already.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
The TV is turned to the news.

CNN ANCHOR
[on TV] ...certain debate will be coming tomorrow morning when GOP leaders
plan to roll
out their ambitious $800 billion tax cut plan-- their prescription for an
ailing economy.

SENATOR ALAN BRODERICK [GOP LEADER]
[on TV] It's you money, and you ought to keep more of it, because you earned
it. This
is exactly hat hardworking Americans deserve.

	FRIDAY NIGHT
	OVER THE GRAND CANYON

CNN ANCHOR
[on TV] Still no response from the White House on what is certan to be the
biggest and
the most contentious debate of this new Congressional session.

LARRY
He's going to go out of his mind.

TOBY
I'm going to go with him.

ED
Isn't that worse then we thought it was going to be?

DONNA
It is.

TOBY
We though it was going to be...

LARRY
They did 15 across the board. That's what it sounds like, but I haven't look
at anything yet.

ED
Plus capital gains.

TOBY
That's what I thought we were talking about. I didn't even realize the 15%.

Andy comes walking into the room.

ANDY
Did you just see that?

TOBY
Oh, my God. Have you been on the plane the whole time?

ANDY
No, I hopped on board when you guys were over the Great Lakes! What the
hell...?

TOBY
What are you doing here?

ANDY
I told you I was coming.

TOBY
And I told you you couldn't fly.

ANDY
And Dr. Salmi said I could fly through the 32nd week, and I thought since
he's my
doctor, and you're really dumb, I'd join the Congressional delegation and
help out
Sam. Isn't it great?

TOBY
Listen to me. We've got all kinds of atmospheric cabin pressure up here. We're
a little
late, so the Colonel's put the hammer down in a 747. You've got windshear,
downdraft,
massive turbulence, not to mention four giant engines burning jet fuel at
galactic
temperatures. We're standing in a flying death tube!

He turns and sees Donna, Ed and Larry staring.

TOBY
No, not the rest of y-you. It's just my family. It's, it's fine. [to Andy]
Look...

ANDY
What do you want me to do, step off?

TOBY
Also, you've got twins in there. You're basically a minivan. How are you
fitting into
a seat?

ANDY
[to Donna] Ah-ah! I saw him first girls.

Donna exits the room to the plane HALLWAY.

DONNA
Josh.

JOSH
Yeah?

DONNA
I checked the voicemail at the office, and there were a couple of messages
from a man
named Ivan Perez of the California Agricultural Laborers Association.

JOSH
Say that again.

DONNA
The California Agricultural Laborers Association. He's staying in our hotel
and he wants
to know if he can get five minutes.

JOSH
I don't know. I don't know him. Find out if he's for real before I meet with
him.

DONNA
How?

JOSH
You meet with him.

DONNA
What litmus test would you like me to use?

JOSH
Well, to begin with, is he wearing shoes and shirt?

DONNA
Say he is.

JOSH
Ask him what he thinks of Richard Sutter. He's an Assemblyman who proposed
the Foreign
Labor... It doesn't matter. If he doesn't have a strong opinion on Sutter,
he doesn't
play at your level.

DONNA
I have a level?

JOSH
You do. It's not a lot to speak of, but you know, no shoes no shirt, I'm
sorry, but
you draw the line.

DONNA
Richard Sutter.

JOSH
An Assemblyman.

Donna leaves and C.J. walks up and grabs a soda.

C.J.
We've begun spreading our magic already.

JOSH
What happened?

C.J.
Some wires got crossed between the Advance and Airlift Operations and CHP
on the ground.
They didn't get the word until late that take-off had been delayed and they
also thought
we were coming into SNA and not Los Alamitos.

JOSH
The result being?

C.J.
Interstate 5 has been shut down for an hour and a half.

JOSH
Is that a freeway that gets used a lot?

C.J.
Not for the last hour and a half, no.

JOSH
All right, has the President seen any of the news on the Republican tax cut?

C.J. and Josh keep walking as Bartlet walks out of a room reading a piece
of paper into
his OFFICE.

BARTLET
No response from the White House?

Ed, Larry and Toby are in the office.

BARTLET
[blows raspberry] There's my response.

LARRY
Plus, it's worse than we thought.

ED
It is.

BARTLET
[to Ed] Sing it, Larry.

ED
Ed.

BARTLET
15% cut across the board? Cutting capital gains 50%!

TOBY
And they said it would cost $800 billion.

C.J. and Josh enter the room.

BARTLET
And it's actually going to cost?

JOSH
$1.2 trillion.

BARTLET
I'm not an economist, but no... Wait, I am an economist. So, their plan will
do what, C.J.?

C.J.
Explode...

BARTLET
Explode the deficit. Will it stimulate the economy, Josh?

JOSH
It will stimulate the Swiss economy.

BARTLET
Josh gets extra credit for being funny and right at the same time, and how
long do I have
to stay quiet, Toby?

TOBY
You're the leader of the free world, sir. You can speak anytime you like.

BARTLET
And not kill Sam?

TOBY
No, for that you got to shut up for 50 hours.

BARTLET
And so I shall.

CUT TO: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - NIGHT
Will is in the Communications Office when Elsie enters.

ELSIE
You wanted to see me?

WILL
What are you doing right now?

ELSIE
Some remarks for the First Lady. It's Convocation for the Estonian-American
Women in
the Arts Week.

WILL
Is this a joke?

ELSIE
No.

WILL
How many Estonian-American women are there in the arts?

ELSIE
I don't know.

WILL
When are you going to be done?

ELSIE
Tonight.

WILL
Okay, I need you the rest of the weekend.

ELSIE
You've got a staff.

WILL
They don't like me.

ELSIE
The Rice Krispie Treats?

WILL
Did not do the job.

ELSIE
They work for you.

WILL
Try telling them that.

ELSIE
Have you tried telling them that?

WILL
No.

ELSIE
Why?

WILL
'Cause these are hard-boiled men, some of whom have known the President
since seventh
grade and some of whom still write like they were there.

They walk out to the HALLWAY.

ELSIE
And they're hard-boiled?

WILL
Yeah. You know we took Bitanga Airport this morning?

ELSIE
You think we don't watch the news down there?

WILL
I'm just saying.

ELSIE
You think the President took Bitanga 'cause you told him to?

WILL
He hasn't taken Bitanga, just the airport, and no, I'm just saying. You
know...

ELSIE
Yeah.

WILL
Things happen fast.

ELSIE
Yeah.

Elsie watches as Will exits the West Wing.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is in his office talking to Robbie and Thomas.

LEO
He's not in...

ROBBIE
Nzele's demanding...

LEO
He's not in a position to be demanding anything.

ROBBIE
Nonetheless, he's demanding that American troops leave Bitanga immediately.

LEO
And?

THOMAS
And he'll continue the peace talks among the African countries.

LEO
No.

THOMAS
Leo, Nzele is a sadistic madman. This can't possibly be argued. But he's
not a stupid
man, and he knows where CNN is on his television. He's betting the first
dead American
soldier on television and you lose.

LEO
Our stomach for it?

THOMAS
Yes.

LEO
Thomas, Robbie-- you've got to find a way of getting word to Nzele that in
23 hours
he's going to lose that bet.

CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Will is walking in the basement. He enters an OFFICE. There are four young
women dressed
up standing around.

WILL
Hi.

CASSIE TATUM
Good evening.

WILL
Um, I'm WIll Bailey.

CASSIE
Yes, sir. We're the interns for the speechwriting staff.

WILL
Where are they?

CASSIE
Who?

WILL
The speechwriting staff?

CASSIE
I'm not sure.

WILL
What's your name?

LAUREN CHIN
Lauren Chin.

WILL
Lauren, do me a favor. Can you find out where the staff is?

LAUREN CHIN
Well, Cassie said...

CASSIE
Mr. Ziegler left a message that you should call him.

WILL
You're Cassie.

CASSIE
Cassie Tatum, and this is Lauren Shelby, Lauren Romano...

WILL
Three of you are named Lauren?

CASSIE
Yes, sir.

WILL
Lauren, Lauren, Cassie and Lauren.

ALL
Yes, sir.

WILL
And you don't know where the staff is, and Toby tells me to call him?

CASSIE
Yes.

WILL
Okay, I'm just going to step in this office over here a moment.

Will goes over into the OFFICE and picks up the phone and dials.

WILL
[to interns] You're all pretty dressed up.

CASSIE
There's an intern party tonight, but Mr. Ziegler told us to stay.

WILL
[to interns] Doesn't sound that good, does it? [into phone] Toby, it's Will.

CUT TO: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
Toby is on the phone and C.J. is sitting next to him.

TOBY
74 degrees in February. There's no civilization here.

WILL
Where's the staff?

TOBY
Hmm?

WILL
I was just starting the staff meeting, and there's no staff.

TOBY
Yeah, I fired some of them.

WILL
How many of them?

TOBY
All of them.

WILL
You fired the speechwriting staff?

TOBY
I was thinking about what you said this morning, and I think they have a
bad attitude.
Also, they're pretty bad at their jobs.

WILL
When are we going to have new speechwriters?

TOBY
Just as soon as you hire them.

WILL
All right, I'll get it done myself.

TOBY
You can't.

WILL
I can't?

TOBY
You can't. That's why I left you a staff.

WILL
The interns?

TOBY
Tell them what you want, and then expect it.

WILL
That isn't a staff, Toby. Those are the Robert Palmer girls.

TOBY
They're bright young women. Show some leadership skills. Get it done. We're
here.
I'll call you in a little bit.

WILL
Okay. The speechwriting staff-- you didnt fire them, they quit, right?

TOBY
Yeah.

WILL
Because of me, right?

TOBY
Yeah.

WILL
Okay, thanks.

Will hangs up the phone and walks into the room where the interns are.

WILL
Hi.

CUT TO: EXT. CURBSIDE IN CALIFORNIA - NIGHT
The Presidential motorcade pulls up to where a rally for Sam's campaign is
being held.
Sam is standing at the corner waiting for them when they arrive. C.J. exits
the car.

C.J.
I'm sorry.

SAM
Don't worry about it.

They hug.

C.J.
Hi.

SAM
Toby!

TOBY
Sorry about that.

Toby and Sam hug.

SAM
Don't worry about it.

C.J.
Did we do much damage?

SAM
They got a photograph of an American SUV with three kids in the back crying
'cause they
were stuck getting home from Disney's California Adventure. Listen, I feel
bad you made
the trip now. Who knew the Republicans were going to announce? Plus, he's
got to be
distracted by Kuhndu.

C.J.
He's fine.

Bartlet gets out of the limousine.

C.J.
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Man, I'm sorry about this. [hugs Sam]

SAM
Thank you for coming. I was just saying you must be distracted by Kuhndu.

BARTLET
The French have denied us access to their airspace. I'm not sure why they
think we're
going to need it to get from here to Africa, but what the hell. This weekend's
all
about you. Get up there.

CHARLIE
[hands Bartlet a phone] It's Leo.

They have now arrived at a platform. Sam mounts the platform leaving Bartlet
and
Charlie offstage talking.

BARTLET
This is going to be about France. Did we accidently trap people in a theme
park?

CHARLIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
[into phone] Yeah?

Sam is standing at the podium in front of a "Seaborn for Congress" banner. The
crowd
is cheering and holding up signs of support for Sam.

SAM
Thank you very much. Thank you. You've heard from a lot of people tonight
and many of
them were me. I'm happy to see that so many teachers here tonight brought
students.
The man that I worked for is not only a great President; he's an extraordinary
role
model. And someone you can honestly...

While Sam is onstage, Bartlet can be heard offstage talking really loudly
on the
phone with Leo.

BARTLET [OS]
Leo, tell those poncy little hairdressers I'm going to shove a loaf of bread
up
their ass...

SAM
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

The crowd begins to cheer as "Hail to the Chief" begins to play. Bartlet
walk onstage,
and he and Sam embrace. Bartlet holds Sam's hand in the air as the crowd
cheers.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. OFFICE - DAY
Elsie and the interns are in the office waiting when Will enters.

WILL
Good morning.

ALL
Good morning.

WILL
These are for you.

He hands them jerseys with numbers on them.

CASSIE
You want us to put them on?

WILL
It would move things along. You've met my sister Elsie?

ALL
Yeah.

WILL
Yesterday afternoon, the Republican Leadership unveiled their tax plan. On
Monday
morning, we're going to unveil ours, which means that all public remarks
coming from
the White House have to be about the Democratic tax plan. So, I need you
all to help
to take prepared remarks, say about the canning of catfish, and make it
about the tax
plan. Number 60, what are you writing down?

LAUREN ROMANO [#60]
Canning of catfish.

WILL
That was just an espression.

ROMANO
I never heard it.

ELSIE
I've never heard it either.

WILL
I just made it up. 21, What's a capital gain?

LAUREN SHELBY [#21]
Um, anytime you invest in something and make money off it.

WILL
Right, what do Republicans want, 48?

LAUREN CHIN [#48]
No taxes on capital gains.

WILL
Right. Plus, a 15% cut across the board, while our plan would raise taxes
one percent
on the richest one percent in the country. So, what can be said about the
differences
between the two?

CASSIE
They want to lower taxes and we want to raise them.

WILL
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.

CASSIE
You just did.

WILL
I'm saying when you write your remarks into the catfish canning remarks...

CASSIE
Will, we're interns. Do you think we have clue as to how to write a tax
policy speech?

WILL
Well, I'm sure you had to write in college in the many, many government and
poly-sci
and economics classes you took while attending...?

CASSIE
The London School of Ballet.

WILL
What the hell are you doing here?

CASSIE
I'm changing directions.

The telephone rings.

WILL
[into phone] Will Bailey.

TOBY
It's me.

WILL
What the hell happened last night?

TOBY
We got off to a rough start.

WILL
I'd really like a chance to talk to Scott Holcomb.

TOBY
Don't worry about the campaign.

WILL
I think he's blowing the work we did down there.

TOBY
Don't worry about it. How are the remarks coming?

WILL
Uh, great. These guys are pros. [to Elsie] Elsie, what are you doing?

Elsie is standing over number 60.

ELSIE
I'm erasing "canning of catfish."

WILL
[into phone] Okay, got to go.

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
Toby walks over to the table where C.J., Sam and Josh are sitting down
reading newspapers.

C.J.
Well, there are some nice shots of you and the President, but the one you're
going to
see a lot of is you kissing a liberal, pregnant, unwed congresswoman.

SAM
Yeah.

TOBY
Kissing her where?

JOSH
The Journal's attacking him for campaigning at the same time he's sending
troops overseas.

SAM
What the Register and Daily Pilot term "insulting remarks" at the school
have made their
special pull-out section.

TOBY
They minded he insulted the French?

C.J.
Or "poncy hairdressers," it's not clear...

SAM
Yeah, but he also mentioned vouchers, closing the 5, 405 and the 55 didn't
play well.
And because he was late he couldn't see off a battalion leaving from Miramar,
flights
out of John Wayne were held on the ground and of course, children crying at
the "Pirates
of the Carribean," and it's still 6:30 in the morning.

C.J.
So, you'd rate the trip so far, what, B, B-minus? C-minus? We'll get it
together.

SAM
I have no idea what makes me say this, but it's good to see you. I have a
strategy
breakfast.

JOSH
You want me to come?

SAM
That's okay.

TOBY
Let him come, Sam.

SAM
Yeah, well, you know, the thing is Scott Holcomb and Josh.

JOSH
Oh, come on.

C.J.
I think Holcomb's been making bad mistakes with you, Sam. I think Josh's
been right.

TOBY
I know Josh has been right and if you think that's easy for me to say...

JOSH
He's got you with business.

SAM
He says it's how a Democrat wins Orange County.

JOSH
Has a Democrat ever won Orange County?

SAM
No.

JOSH
Then how would he know?

SAM
That's a fair point, but it's who the national committee wants running the
campaign,
and that's where money's coming from so I have a strategy breakfast and I'll
see you
all a little bit later.

Sam gets up and walks over by the door. Josh follows him.

JOSH
I wasn't trying to get under his skin. On the other hand, I didn't really
care that
I had, you know what I mean?

SAM
Yeah.

JOSH
Some polls that have you within seven. If you only lost by seven, that would
be huge, man.

SAM
I don't want to think like that yet.

JOSH
Good.

Sam leaves.

JOSH
Okay, where are we?

C.J. and Toby place papers in front of him that say "Democrats Idle On Tax
Cut Debate."

CUT TO: INT. HOTEL CAFE - DAY
Donna is sitting at a table across from IVAN "IZZY" PEREZ from the California
Agricultural
Laborers Association.

IVAN PEREZ
They work the land and through intensive labor develop pride in the
property. Labor is
intrinsically social, right? No man can create something by himself. Denying
migrant
workers an equal share of the profits...

A photographer walks up to the table with a camera.

DONNA
[to photographer] Hello.

IVAN
...let me put it this way.

The photographer snaps a picture and walks away.

DONNA
That was weird.

IVAN
That happens to me sometimes.

DONNA
Are you a farm labor leader and a rock star?

IVAN
No. But my point was we have no way of determining whether 12 hours under
the sun,
picking grapes is worth less or more than 9:00 to 5:00 in an office.

DONNA
True. True. But let me ask you this, Ivan.

IVAN
Yes.

DONNA
What do you think of Richard Sutter?

IVAN
I'm sorry?

DONNA
Richard Sutter. I was just wondering what you opinion of Richard...?

IVAN
Well, he's the enemy, is what he is. I mean simply put, he is the enemy. This
is an
Assemblyman who led the charge for...

DONNA
Excellent.

IVAN
Um, I'm sorry?

DONNA
He was. And I think what you have to say is valuable and I'm going to see
if I can get
you in to see Josh while we're here.

IVAN
That's wonderful. Thank you.

DONNA
Good meeting you.

Donna gets up from the table. She begins walking and runs into Sam who's
just coming
into the building.

SAM
Donna!

DONNA
Hi.

SAM
[to Scott Holcomb and an aide] Hey, everyone, this is one of my best
friends. This is
Donna Moss.

Sam kisses Dona on the cheek.

SAM
I didn't get the chance to see you much last night. How are you doing?

DONNA
Oh, everyone feels really bad about the start.

SAM
Don't worry about it. Where are you coming from?

DONNA
Five minutes with a guy named Ivan Perez from the California Agricultural
Laborers
Association. Josh wanted me to find out if he's legit.

SAM
Is he?

DONNA
I think.

SAM
[to Scott and his aides] Anyone ever heard of Ivan Perez?

AIDE 1
The farm guy?

DONNA
Yeah.

AIDE 1
Izzy Perez?

DONNA
Yeah.

SAM
Donna just met with him.

AIDE 1
He ran for Governor of California.

SAM
What party?

SCOTT HOLCOMB
Communist.

DONNA
The Communist Party?

SCOTT
Yeah.

DONNA
He's a Communist?

SCOTT
Yeah.

DONNA
I thought he was a farmer.

SCOTT
They're all farmers.

SAM
Take it easy. Donna, did anybody see you having coffee?

DONNA
Yeah.

SAM
Who?

DONNA
A photographer.

SCOTT
Oh, my God.

AIDE 1
Honest to God, lady, how stupid can you be?

SAM
[to aide] Hey! Out of here. You're fired.

SCOTT
I need him.

SAM
I don't care. He's out of here.

AIDE 1
Your going to get creamed.

SAM
Like I'm not used to that.

CUT TO: INT. THE WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
Leo walks through the Roosevelt Room and pass the Communications Office. Will
sees him
and catches up with him.

WILL
Excuse me, Leo.

LEO
Hey, how's it going down there?

WILL
Fine.

LEO
I heard your staff quit.

WILL
Yes, yes, they did.

LEO
Because we promoted you to deputy?

WILL
It would appear so.

LEO
Well, that's a little small.

WILL
Whatever. Do you suppose there's anyone around with speechwriting experience,
I could
borrow for a day or two?

LEO
On Saturday?

WILL
Bad day?

LEO
Not ordinarily, but a lot of people made the California trip, the Treasury
Secretary's
staff is in the Midwest.

WILL
No problem. Is there anything I can do for you?

LEO
For me?

WILL
With regard to whatever's happening right now. I feel a little responsible.

LEO
You are.

WILL
You need me to prepare remarks at all?

LEO
I hope not.

Leo enters THE SITUATION ROOM. He walks up to Fitz who's standing at the
end of the table.

LEO
When was the last flyover?

FITZWALLACE
A Superhornet did a past in the last hour.

LEO
Are we seeing any pictures of the Arkutu getting ready to surrender?

FITZWALLACE
No. Here's what we're seeing. [shows Leo black and white reconnaisance photos]
These are
3,200 Induye being marched down a road toward Mutsato. These are cranes and
bulldozers
at work and twice as amny smokestacks burning as of an hour ago. So this is
the mass
gravesite that the 3,200 Induye are being marched to.

LEO
How many more in the next 20 hours?

FITZWALLACE
We think about 20,000.

LEO
So why not talk about blowing off the deadline?

FITZWALLACE
'Cause we'd need 55 more aircraft of the U.S.S. Colonade and 3rd Infantry.

LEO
He's trying to finish the job before the deadline.

FITZWALLACE
Yes.

Leo walks out of the Situation Room and Fitz stands still looking at the
pictures.

FADE OUT.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
C.J. is holding an informal press briefing with the White House Press Corps.

REPORTER KATIE
Is the President monitoring the situation in Kuhndu?

C.J.
Sure. He's getting continuous updates. He's also spoken by phone today with
the UN
Secretary-General and the leadership of the World Bank and the IMF to begin
discussing
rebuilding packages after the Arkutu stepdown.

REPORTER JOHN
Can you talk about the rest of the afternoon?

C.J.
He'll have a conference call with his economics team.

REPORTER STEVE
That's about the Democratic response?

C.J.
The tax plan isn't a response to the Republicans, it's a tax plan, and yes.

REPORTER JENN
Any California issues on the schedule?

C.J.
A series of meetings upstairs in his suite. The California leadership of
the FOP the
Governor and the State Assembly Leadership on matching payments before he
goes on to
the fund-rasier.

REPORTER MARK
Yeah, speaking of California politics?

C.J.
Was a White House aide sent to meet with the Communist Party's candidate
for governor?

REPORTER MARK
Yeah.

C.J.
No, Donna Moss was sent to meet with the head of the California Agricultural
Laborers
Association, a man named Ivan Perez, who, it turns out has some loose ties
to the
American Communist Party.

REPORTER KATIE
He's their standard-bearer.

C.J.
Like that one. Mr. Perez was heard, as he certainly has a right to be,
and that's that.

REPORTER STEVE
How do you think the picture of Donna and Mr. Perez is going to play in
Orange County?

C.J.
Really, really well. I'll talk to you before the dinner. Thank you.

ALL
Thank you, C.J.

CUT TO: INT. WEST WING OFFICE - NIGHT
The interns all have on their jerseys and are sitting at the table as Will
walks
around reading what they have written.

WILL
"Nothing is more important than teaching our children well." This is
good. These are
remarks prepared by number 48 for the Undersecretary of Education at the
AFT Leadership
Breakfast. Very good start. "Nothing is more important than teaching our
children well,
grounding them in the basics. And while we're at it, We should teach them
that the
Republican tax plan is a job killer..." Yeah, I don't think this is going
to work out,
do you?

ELSIE
Got to give us points for our candor.

WILL
Number 24...

CASSIE [#24]
[irritated] Cassie!

WILL
In remarks to the National Headache Foundation said... Is there really a
National
Headache Foundation or did you just make that up, like the London School of
Ballet?

The telephone in the office begins to ring.

CASSIE [#24]
Yeah. I was an American Studies major at the University of Texas.

WILL
Yes. I know you were. You don't know I know how to retreive information.

CASSIE
What were you doing looking me up?

WILL
What was I doing? My job, okay? That's what I was doing.

CHIN [#48]
[to Will] Phone's for you.

ELSIE
Thank God, huh?

WILL
Will Bailey.

TOBY
[on phone] How's it going?

WILL
Hey, why would Holcomb book Sam in the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce?

TOBY
Did I tell you to worry about the speeches or did I tell you to worry about
Sam's campaign?

WILL
I worry about Sam's campaign without anyone telling me to.

TOBY
Read me what you've got for the swearing in of the Ambassador.

WILL
"Ambassador Stanis will help to build and sustain a new era of cooperation
between the
United States and Hungary. And let's please all remember that cutting capital
gains
taxes is a bad idea."

TOBY
Okay, you're going to polish that up?

WILL
Yeah.

CUT TO: INT. BAR IN CALIFORNIA - NIGHT
Toby walks out of a room from talking on the phone with Will. He walks past
Charlie
and Jean-Paul playing pool.

JEAN-PAUL
Who will pay in the tax plan you're proposing?

CHARLIE
The President.

JEAN-PAUL
I don't understand.

CHARLIE
The President's proposing the tax plan, not me.

JEAN-PAUL
Who will pay?

CHARLIE
The White House wants to raise taxes on the wealthies one percent of the
population by
one percent, in order to pay for college tuition to be fully tax deductible
for anyone
making under $80,000 a year, and incrementally tax deductible after that. Does
that
make sense?

JEAN-PAUL
No, because it is ridiculous.

CHARLIE
That's 'cause you're part of the one percent.

JEAN-PAUL
No, I don't think taxes are too high, I think they are too low. You see? You
don't know me.

CHARLIE
Yeah. Speaking of people getting to know you, you and Zoey went to a couple
of runway
shows in Paris, and there were an awful lot of pictures.

JEAN-PAUL
That is avoidable?

CHARLIE
It's not completely avoidable, but it's a little avoidable. And you should try,
'cause
it's a security risk.

JEAN-PAUL
Why?

CHARLIE
'Cause of the details crazy people pick out of photographs. You can make
the scene
without making a scene. You know what I'm saying?

JEAN-PAUL
I took Zoey home to meet my parents.

CHARLIE
Your parents weren't at the Versace show.

JEAN-PAUL
She's a sexy girl, Charlie. She likes having her picture taken.

CHARLIE
She doesn't like having her picture taken.

JEAN-PAUL
She doesn't mind having it taken with me.

Zoey walks up.

ZOEY
Hey.

JEAN-PAUL
Ah. We were talking about taxes, of all things.

ZOEY
Oh.

Zoey and Jean-Paul begin to passionately kiss in front of Charlie.

CHARLIE
Well, I've got to get to Sam's rally.

ZOEY
We're right behind you.

Charlie walks past where C.J., Andy, Toby and Donna are sitting down.

C.J.
[to Toby] You and Josh need to take over the campaign.

TOBY
We've asked.

C.J.
Just for the last week.

TOBY
We've asked. We said we'd go off the White House payroll. I've had to bungee
Will to
his desk. Until higher authorities steps in, the DNC wants Holcomb.

C.J.
When they have him in community centers at a podium...

TOBY
I know.

C.J.
...it looks like he's wearing his dad's old suit. He's got youth and
vitality. He should...

TOBY
I know.

DONNA
Communist look exactly like non-Communist.

TOBY
Tell me about it.

A man and a woman walking together approach their table.

MAN
Miss Wyatt, those kids you got in there deserve a father.

ANDY
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

MAN
Yes, I was. That's all.

ANDY
They've got a father, and it's Congresswoman Wyatt, not Miss.

The man laughs.

MAN
Whatever you say.

ANDY
Damn right, whatever I say.

MAN
You may not realize it... but you are an example to young women, and there's
something
to be said for acting like it.

ANDY
Well, I believe I do.

MAN
You do?

C.J.
Sir, you are way out of line, and we're having a private conversation,
but thank you...

BETTY
No, it's not private when you're an elected official.

ANDY
[stands up] Well, I appreciate you reminding me of my sworn duty, and if
it's all right
with you...

MAN
Yeah, but it's not all right with me...

ANDY
Well, I'm sorry to hear that....

MAN
Y-You should be sorry!

TOBY
Okay, sir, you're standing too close now.

BETTY
It's the father.

TOBY
Yeah, it's the father and you're standing too close, so, if you're going to
insist on
being drunk and minding other people's business, you've got to take a step
back, 'cause
as you are apparently aware, the Congresswoman is pregnant.

Charlie seeing the scene from across the room has walked over.

CHARLIE
Is there a problem, Toby?

BETTY
This is the one who was with the daughter.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Leo is in a meeting with Thomas and Robbie.

LEO
He's killed 115,000 people and he wants to stay in power, get immunity and
cash a check

ROBBIE
Yes.

There's a knock on the door.

we're
fine. And tell Andy not to come here. We'll meet her there as soon as we're
done.
[to officer taking Charlie's fingerprints] Excuse me, Officer, ballpark--
How long
do you think this is going to be?

OFFICER
Assault-- six to 20 months.

CHARLIE
It wasn't assault. He slipped on a thing.

OFFICER
Yeah, one of the guys says you hit him.

CHARLIE
Well, that was different. That part may have been assault.

TOBY
[into phone] Tell him he's got to hit hard on quality-- health care quality--
and in
his acknowledgements he's got to...

OFFICER
[to Toby] Okay.

TOBY
[to Officer] One second. [into phone] In his acknowledgements, he's got to
mention the
AFL folk. The President's working the...

OFFICER
Buddy.

TOBY
The President's working the rope line for 15...

CHARLIE
No.

TOBY
No. Charlie says no on the rope line.

OFFICER
Hey, give me the damn phone.

TOBY
And if you can call the NEC and get a one-pager on trucking faxed to me in
my cell,
I'd really...

OFFICER
Now!

TOBY
Okay. I got to go. I'm under arrest. [hangs up]

CHARLIE
He's not going to know the names of the people he's meeting.

TOBY
Does he ever know the names of the people's he's meeting?

Okay, over here. Give me your left thumb.

Perfect.

SCOTT
We got a new shirt?

SAM
Yeah, they got it.

SCOTT
[to staffers in the room] Can I have the room please?

The staffers leave.

SAM
What's going on?

SCOTT
I'm going to propose something bold.

SAM
I like bold.

SCOTT
The White House is going to announce their answer to the Republican tax plan
on Monday.
It's a one percent tax hike on the wealthiest one percent, which would pay
for, among
other things...

SAM
Tax deductible tuition.

SCOTT
Right. Come out against it tonight.

SAM
Why?

SCOTT
To show you're not bought and paid for by the West Wing. And by the way,
many of that
one percent live right here.

SAM
I worked on it.

SCOTT
On what?

SAM
Tax deductible tuition. I worked on it.

SCOTT
You were doing what the President told you to do.

SAM
Yeah, and the President was also doing what I helped advise him to do.

SCOTT
It doesn't matter, what I'm saying is....

SAM
Wait a second. They're announcing on Monday?

SCOTT
Yeah.

SAM
How do you know?

SCOTT
I know.

SAM
And it's been scored, fully scored?

SCOTT
Yeah.

SAM
Well, why the hell would...? Excuse me.

Sam grabs his coat and walks out.

Bartlet is walking to the auditorium where Sam's rally is being held.

DEBBIE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Mrs. Hottentot?

DEBBIE
Toby and Charlie...

BARTLET
Yeah, where are they?

DEBBIE
They're being held.

BARTLET
What do you mean?

DEBBIE
Toby and Charlie are under arrest. There was an incident at a bar.

BARTLET
They're under arrest?

DEBBIE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Did they rob the bar?

DEBBIE
No, sir. A patron was jostling Congresswoman Wyatt and Toby tried to get
him to step
back, and the man slipped on the floor. And then the man's friend lunged
for Toby.

BARTLET
Uh-huh. And what did Charlie do?

DEBBIE
He hit him.

JOSH
Sir.

BARTLET
Toby and Charlie were arrested in a bar fight.

JOSH
Yes, sir, it's not going to be a problem. C.J.'s taking care of it.

BARTLET
Really?

JOSH
It's going to be a little bit of a problem.

BARTLET
Everytime we come to Southern California we are absolutely the Clampetts.

JOSH
He booked him at the Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce. He had him skip a
union lunch
without telling restaurant employees...

BARTLET
I came...

JOSH
He wants him speaking at Cal Lutheran. Scott Holcomb's given up on Sam,
and he's running
his own agenda. Now, I can't leave with the tax proposal coming out, but
Toby says he
can for a week. Evidently, Will's put together a top-flight staff that can
handle the
paper for a week. And I suppose it's worth mentioning that Toby probably
can't leave the
state anyway. Now, as the leader of this party you...

BARTLET
You really don't want to shake up a campaign like this at this point in the
election
calendar.

JOSH
At this point in the election calendar look which way his numbers are
going. I'm amazed
he's kept a veneer of sanity, much less...

Sam comes bursting though the door.

SAM
Are you crazy?!

JOSH
We were just...

SAM
Have you all lost your minds?

JOSH
Well, C.J. maybe.

SAM
I just assumed that it wasn't ready yet. It's ready now, isn't it?

JOSH
Yeah.

SAM
You are missing news cycle after news cycle after news cycle, but you didn't
announce
'cause you didn't want to do it from Orange County.

JOSH
Would you?

SAM
Yes! I say to hell with the election! There's a guy in St. Louis making
$55,000 a year
trying to send his kid to Notre Dame!

BARTLET
Guys, we've got to keep our voices down a little.

AIDE 2
Sam, it's time.

SAM
If I'm going to lose, I'd like to lose doing something.

SPEAKER [OS]
So here he is... the next U.S. Representative from the California 47th
Congressional
District.

Sam walks out on stage and the crowd cheers.

SAM
Thank you. Thank you very much. The President of the United States is
backstage.
He'll be out here in a minute. He'll be out here in a minute because, of
course, he's
monitoring our troops in Kuhndu. But I wanted to say that yesterday the
Republicans
rolled out their tax plan. Do not let this President off this stage until
he's told
you his. Send me to Congress, and mine will be the first yea vote cast.

Scott has now entered the backstage area and is standing next to Bartlet.

SCOTT
He didn't just say that. He did not just say that.

BARTLET
Scott...

SCOTT
Yes, sir?

BARTLET
Why are you putting Sam next to business?

SCOTT
Sir...

BARTLET
No, I'm just curious.

SCOTT
You read numbers as well as anyone, sir. Webb's going to win here. That's
not a surprise.
So why burn the DNC's bridges...?

BARTLET
Josh...

JOSH
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Tell Toby to take over the campaign.

SAM [OS]
You deserve the best healthcare...

SCOTT
You're going to get creamed. [leaves]

Debbie is standing backstage looking through papers when a young man dressed
in a uniform walks up.

LIEUTENANT
Excuse me, ma'am.

DEBBIE
Yes.

LIEUTENANT
Mr. McGarry.

He hands Debbie a cell phone.

DEBBIE
Thank you.

SAM [OS]
...future of clean air, clean water...

Debbie walks over to Bartlet and hands him the phone.

DEBBIE
Sir.

BARTLET
Yeah. [into phone] Leo, I just fired Scott Holcomb. Toby, who, with Charlie,
is meeting
with a bails bondsman right now, has to come off the payroll for a week.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo and Fitzwallace are both in the room sitting in front of a telephone.

LEO
Sir, I'm afraid something has happened.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
Two Marine Lance Corporals and a PFC have been taken.

BARTLET
What do you mean they've been taken?

LEO
Patrolling Bitanga airport in a humvee, 50 guys came out of nowhere.

BARTLET
We secured the airport.

LEO
They came out of nowhere.

BARTLET
What are we doing?

LEO
Special Ops wants to brief you on some rescue scenarios.

BARTLET
We're coming home.

LEO
Nzele says for immunity and $500 million he'll keep them alive.

BARTLET
Tell Ghana to tell Nzele he's got 9 hours and 20 minutes before I take him.

LEO
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Nancy has walked up to Bartlet.

NANCY
Sir, he's about to introduce you.

BARTLET
Thanks.

SAM [OS]
This district needs a Congressman who will work with President Bartlet for
the right
kind of change. A Congressman who'll reach across the aisle to make a real
difference
for Orange County's families. If you send me...

Bartlet is now standing next to the man who brought Debbie the phone.

BARTLET
Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
How old are you?

LIEUTENANT
I'm 22 years old, sir.

SAM
And so, friends, the President of the United States.

BARTLET
Let's go.

Bartlet walks out onstage as the crowd cheers.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
