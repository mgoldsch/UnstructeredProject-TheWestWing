TEASER

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
The TV in Josh's office is muted, but the reporter is reporting a story on:
"Hoynes:
Farewell to Politics". Josh is looking through folders. A board behind him
is loaded
with pictures of different people. He pulls out a seating chart of the Senate
and
crosses off a name. We can assume that he's looking for a replacement for
Hoynes.
Charlie knocks on the door and enters.

CHARLIE
Josh? The President wants to know if we still have the vetting files from
five years ago?

JOSH
For Vice President you mean?

CHARLIE
Yeah. You crossed off McKenna?

JOSH
For health.

CHARLIE
Ryan Lyndell?

JOSH
Yeah. I'm a fan of Lyndell, so is the President, but the Speaker's not,
and this guy
has to get confirmed.

CHARLIE
To much of a moonshot for the Speaker?

JOSH
He's got an Asian garden in the back of his house where he meditates.

CHARLIE
Asian garden? Asian garden, I know what the...

He reaches in his pocket and pulls out his wallet.

CHARLIE
A note fell out of my wallet yesterday, and I couldn't remember what
it... "5/7, 10 PM,
Paeonia Japonica/Bamboo."

JOSH
Both of which one would find in an Asian garden.

CHARLIE
Next to each other at the Arboretum.

Josh walks out into his BULLPEN AREA to get a folder from Donna's desk. Charlie
follows.

CHARLIE [cont]
I wrote this note three and a half years ago, right after Zoey started
school. We buried,
like, a $14 bottle of champagne, and decided we'd dig it up and drink it
right after she
graduated.

JOSH
You buried the champagne at the Arboretum?

CHARLIE
Between the Paeonia Japonica and the bamboo.

JOSH
How do you get away with digging up the National Arboretum?

CHARLIE
Oh, well, you gotta to do it at night.

JOSH
Well, today is the... Today's 5/7.

CHARLIE
I know.

JOSH
You got to get the bottle back.

CHARLIE
No.

JOSH
You do.

CHARLIE
No. I'm done. I gave it a shot. She said no. She said it clearly.

JOSH
You shoud dig it up, it's a good idea.

CHARLIE
She's going to France tomorrow with Tartuffe. I'm gonna eat the fourteen
bucks.

JOSH
No, I mean, as a friend. You give it to her as a graduation present. You
give it to her
at one of the parties tonight. That way she goes off without thinking you're
mad at her.

CHARLIE
I am mad at her.

JOSH
Yeah, but it's not really her fault, and she's going away for a
while. And... anyway, I
don't know what I'm talking about. Let me ask you something. Just between
you and me...
and... I'm not looking for this particular promotion, but... just between
you and me...
what would you think about this choice?

Josh rips something from a newspaper and sticks it on the board. Charlie
looks at the
picture.

CHARLIE
You got the vetting file?

Josh hands Charlie a folder and he walks out.

JOSH
See you later.

We see that it is a picture of Bartlet waving and Leo walking behind him.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

NANCY
No, the FBI found the van abandoned in Sacramento.

BARTLET
How were they able to rent a van?

NANCY
Sir, I'm joining those who are recommending Threat Condition Bravo. I think
at the very
least we have to increase security at the airports and the seaports.

BARTLET
[reading a note] "A torrential downpour in the Pacific Northwest."

NANCY
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
"A torrential downpour."

NANCY
Yes.

BARTLET
And they're just missing?

FITZWALLACE
Yes.

BARTLET
The five of them, they're just missing?

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
We're going to work on that?

AIDE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Threat Con Bravo. Find them. Threat Con Bravo. Leo and I will be back.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

AMY
Hey, Donna, the First Lady wanted you to know that Mary and Fred Wellington
are back
on the trip, so we need to deal with that.

DONNA
All right.

AMY
Yeah. You know Josh came by this morning to show me a list of six possible
nominees,
and I thought it was a very good list. And I said, "Wow, well, this is a
windfall."
And... he got very quiet, and it occured to me after he left that I he may
have thought
I meant it's great that the Vice President had to resign 'cause now we get
one of these
guys. Did he happen to mention anything about that?

DONNA
No.

AMY
I didn't mean it was good the Vice President had to resign.

DONNA
I'll tell Josh about the Wellington's.

AMY
Okay.

CUT TO: INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY
Toby is pacing back and forth when C.J. enters.

C.J.
Good morning.

TOBY
Good morning.

C.J.
Big day.

TOBY
Yes.

C.J.
Are you nervous?

TOBY
How do you know about this?

C.J.
The house?

TOBY
Yeah.

C.J.
Not because you told me.

TOBY
That's right.

WILL
Hey.

C.J.
Hey.

TOBY
Hey.

WILL
I'm glad he's finally asking for help with the speech.

TOBY
It's not going to be about commencement.

WILL
Why not?

TOBY
'Cause he's not going to call the four of us in Saturday morning at 8:00 to
work on a
commencement speech.

WILL
Aren't you nervous you haven't seen it?

TOBY
I'm choosing to be nervous about other things today.

WILL
Oh, hey, that's right, big day.

TOBY
Is he taking about the house?

WILL
It's romantic.

TOBY
[to Josh who has just walked in] They know about the house!

JOSH
Did you tell them?

TOBY
No. Did you?

JOSH
It's a bold, romantic gesture. I spread it around, got you some good will. I
think I
turned some people around on you.

Charlie enters from Oval Office.

CHARLIE
You can go in.

CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet is talking on the phone.

LEO
Go ahead and sit down. He's going to be a second. How you doing?

TOBY
Good.

LEO
What is it, two weeks?

TOBY
In ten days, we can pick a day on the calendar and they'll induce.

LEO
You can pick a day?

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
That's great, so you can do it on a Friday, let the kids get their feet wet
over the
weekend.

TOBY
Yeah.

LEO
Let me tell you something... you know what I'd do? I'd check into the hospital
today.
You can't do it too soon. Mallory was very nearly born at Exit 322 on the
Long Island
Expressway.

BARTLET
[into phone] Thanks.

Bartlet hangs up the phone and walks over to the staff.

BARTLET
Yeah, listen, I don't think this is going to come as a galloping shock to
anyone here,
but last May I ordered a Special Ops unit to kill Abdul Shareef, and that's
what they
did, and we we made it look like what got reported.

LEO
Anybody need him to stop?

JOSH
No, sir.

LEO
Anybody need a minute?

TOBY
No, sir.

C.J.
No, sir.

LEO
There was considerable evidence presented to a group that included Fitzwallace,
Nancy,
Berryhill, Babish, the Attorney General and a few others. We gave it to the
gang of
eight. The man had committed crimes and remained a threat. For instance,
we stopped
him from blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge. Were U.S. laws
broken? No. International
law? Possibly.

BARTLET
See, I said we took Shareef, and they said fine, and then you went on talking
for
another five, ten minutes.

C.J.
Mr. President...

BARTLET
Yes?

C.J.
Why the decision to tell us this morning?

BARTLET
Well, I just ordered Threat Con Bravo, so people are going to be seeing some
heightened
security this weekend.

C.J.
What's the threat?

LEO
Increased chatter about torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest. It's
pouring rain
in the Pacific Northwest.

WILL
I'm sure the analyst have already thought of this, but, you know, it is
raining in the
Pacific Northwest.

LEO
For a couple of years we've been keeping an eye on five possible Bahji
sleepers in
Central New York. And last night they disappeared. We lost them.

JOSH
We lost them?

BARTLET
We did.

JOSH
And we're worried about retribution for Shareef?

LEO
Yes.

JOSH
Can I ask, how hard can it be to keep an eye on five Qumari religious fanatics
in
Schenectady?

BARTLET
Tell him, sister.

LEO
I think you'd both be surprised. Anything else?

WILL
How'd you get Shareef's plane to land?

LEO
Thank you.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

TOBY
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
Oh, hey, Toby, big day.

C.J. and JOSH
Big day.

BARTLET
The house, a masterstroke. Come on, give us a kiss.

TOBY
Thank you, no, sir.

BARTLET
Okay.

They all exit except for Will.

BARTLET
Yes?

WILL
Well, sir, I have time today... right now. I was wondering if you'd like me
to look
over the Georgetown speech?

BARTLET
No, I don't need help.

WILL
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Yeah... I need help.

WILL
Yes, sir, I'd be happy to. Why don't you let me read what you have?

BARTLET
What I have?

WILL
Yeah.

BARTLET
Well, it's been said that I have a pleasant speaking voice and oratorical
style.

WILL
You don't have anything?

BARTLET
On paper?

WILL
Yeah.

BARTLET
No.

WILL
It's at 4:00.

BARTLET
Yeah.

WILL
We should probably get started.

BARTLET
Yeah, right away I would think.

WILL
Yeah.

BARTLET
Except at this minute, I have to go over and meet the agents who are beening
detailed
to Zoey for France. They speak French. As well as being secret service
agents. I didn't
mean they speak French and so therefore are guarding Zoey in France.

WILL
Yeah, I got it, sir.

BARTLET
I have been thinking that I'd like to talk about creativity. Why don't you
get started
on some thoughts, and I'll join you.

WILL
Yes, sir.

CUT TO: INT. NORTHWEST LOBBY - DAY
Josh meets SPECIAL AGENT WESLEY DAVIS, head of Zoey's detail.

JOSH
Wesley.

WESLEY DAVIS
Hey, Josh, how's it going?

JOSH
You back?

WESLEY
No, I go to France tomorrow morning. I'm leading Bookbag's paparazzi patrol
for three
months.

JOSH
Really?

WESLEY
Yeah.

JOSH
It's a bit of a powder-puff detail there, isn't it, fella?

WESLEY
I go where I'm told.

JOSH
So, in your training, what were you taught to do if, say a stringer for Town
and Country
were to get in her face?

They walk to the HALLWAY.

WESLEY
You know I can kill you and just make up the reason why I did, right?

JOSH
Oh, yeah.

CUT TO: INT. RESIDENCE HALLWAY - DAY
Bartlet enters the hallway where two women and a man are waiting.

BARTLET
Hi.

JAMIE REED
Good morning, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Are you friends of Zoey's?

JAMIE REED
No, sir. Special Agent Jamie Reed, U.S. Secret Service.

MOLLY O'CONNOR
Molly O'Connor, sir.

RANDY WEATHERS
Randy Weathers.

Ron Butterfield enters with Wesley Davis.

RON
Excuse me, Mr. President.

BARTLET
Hey.

RON
You remember Wesley Davis.

BARTLET
Wes, thanks so much for doing this. I know it's not what you like.

WESLEY
No, sir, I'm flattered you asked.

BARTLET
So, let's talk about how this is going to work.

RON
Well, these four agents will be assigned to the current team of 14 that gets
supplemented
by a rotating backup group from the Paris office that's more familiar with
the region.
Wes is the Special Agent in charge.

BARTLET
Well, here's my question. These guys look pretty young to me, and I'm looking
for
something very specific with this detail. This is a father-daughter situation,
and
so what I think I'm looking for in terms of protection would best be
categorized as,
well, overwhelming force. Do they have that? Do they have the ability to
just overwhelm
any danger that might...? Do you have overwh...? Do they have overwhelming
force?

RON
Attack Randy.

Wes rushes towards Randy but Molly steps out in front of her, grabs Wes by
the arm,
flips him to the ground, pulls out her gun and points it in his face.

BARTLET
Wow!

Zoey enters and sees what is going on.

ZOEY
Oh, God, Dad, what are you doing?

BARTLET
This one here tossed Wesley like a bag of potato chips.

ZOEY
Molly, get off of Wesley.

WESLEY
[to Ron] You like calling on me for that one, don't you?

RON
Yep.

BARTLET
You guys know each other?

ZOEY
Molly was on Ellie's detail for a while.

BARTLET
Oh, good. Okay. Well, Ellie's still up and running.

ZOEY
Hi, Wes. Sorry about this.

WESLEY
We're going to be just fine. It's wide-perimeter protection. I'm just going
to need you
to show me your panic button every day.

BARTLET
When do you start?

WESLEY
1800, sir. 6:00 p.m. tonight.

BARTLET
[to Zoey] Are you going back to the campus?

ZOEY
Yeah.

BARTLET
Okay, well, let me ask you this. Would you consider instead of living in
France with
your boyfriend for three months, staying here, living in your room, being
a candy
striper, or surfer?

ZOEY
A candy striper?

BARTLET
Or surfing? You could spend the summer working in a pet shop. We could play
Yahtzee,
and watch movies at night.

ZOEY
Dad, what fantasy is it that's going through your head right now?

BARTLET
What daughters would do their whole lives if I had my way.

ZOEY
I'll see you later.

Zoey leaves.

BARTLET
[to Wesley] Before I forget, if something comes up and you're faced with
the choice
of killing the boyfriend or not killing the boyfriend -- kill the boyfriend.

Leo enters with Fitzwallace.

LEO
Excuse me, sir.

BARTLET
[to Wesley] Excuse me.

RON
Thank you, Mr. Presidnet.

FITZWALLACE
How are you doing,Wes?

WESLEY
Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you.

FITZWALLACE
You take care of that new detail now. They got some mimes over there that
can be
pretty nasty.

WESLEY
Yes, sir.

Leo, Bartlet and Fitzwallace enter the PRESIDENT'S PRIVATE STUDY.

LEO
Harbor Patrol in Portland is reporting that the Agile, a cargo ship in port
for 14
hours now, has a container missing. They're supposed to have 46. They have 45.

BARTLET
What's the registry?

FITZWALLACE
They're flying a Nigerian flag, but it's Syrian ownership.

BARTLET
What are we doing on the ground?

FITZWALLACE
The FBI's hunting down everyone who was on the ship.

BARTLET
How long have they been at it?

FITZWALLACE
One hour.

BARTLET
All right, let's give them another hour. Then have the Coast Gurad close
the port.
Is it the port of Portland? Is it really the port of Portland?

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
They're going to lose $700 million a day 'cause these five guys are
missing. And I
just now got why we're having this meeting.

LEO
What do you mean?

BARTLET
Portland. Torrential rain in the Pacific Northwest.

LEO
Yeah.

BARTLET
Screw the hour. Let's close it down.

FITZWALLACE
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Thanks.

FITZWALLACE
Thank you, Mr. President. [exits]

LEO
Hey... did you know that ten days from now Toby and Andy can pick a day and
the doctor's
going to induce. Thay can decide what day the twins are going to be born.

BARTLET
Well, it's about the last thing they're going to get to decide. So you choose
Tuesday.
20 years later, look what happens.

Bartlet and Leo exit the office.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY
C.J. walks into her office, sits down at her desk and opens up the
newspaper. She looks
over at her couch and sees someone lying there and screams. Danny Concannon,
who was
asleep on the couch, wakes up and yells.

C.J.
You scared me!

DANNY
I was sleeping.

C.J.
What are you doing in here?

DANNY
Hang on a second. I'm not sure.

C.J.
Carol!

Carol enters.

CAROL
Sorry. Yes, Danny's here. Sorry. [exits]

C.J.
Can I help you?

DANNY
I'm a little groggy. It's from when you wake up after you've just fallen. You
know,
it's one of those that really takes you a good long while to snap out of.

C.J.
Can I help you?!

DANNY
You are. I just flew back from Boston. Not Boston. Augsburg, Germany. I just
flew back
from Augsburg, Germany.

C.J.
Danny, you want to go home for a while and then talk to me?

DANNY
No. This, uh, this is important to you. I've been on trains and planes...

C.J.
What?

DANNY
I have a link between the U.S. Government and Abdul Shareef's plane and it's
enough and
we're going to print it, so I'm here to ask the White House if they'd like
to comment.

C.J.
We'll comment as soon as you show me the link.

DANNY
I have a link. It's the pilot. It's Jamil Bari.

C.J.
You've been saying that from the beginning.

DANNY
I've got it now.

C.J.
We'll show it to me and I'll comment on it.

DANNY
We don't need a White House comment to run it.

C.J.
Well, you are not going to run it like this. There are national security
issues involved.

DANNY
My paper's not going to hold off on it unless there are lives in immediate
danger.

C.J.
There are.

DANNY
Show me.

C.J.
Classified security information? I don't think I'm allowed to do that.

DANNY
Then what do we do?

C.J.
Don't run it. Not this weekend. I'm not lying to you about security concerns.

DANNY
Except you've been faffing me around for months.

C.J.
Of course, I have.

DANNY
I'm going to give you a couple of hours to sit down with Leo and figure out
what you
can tell me to convince me I shouldn't print what I have. Otherwise, comment
on it or
don't comment on it, but it's the lead in tomorrow's paper. And by the way,
that's the
brand of courtesy that you have never extended me.

C.J.
I extend you courtesy all the time.

DANNY
When?

C.J.
You just slept on my couch.

DANNY
Oh, right.

C.J.
All right, you'll give me a couple of hours.

DANNY
You know, I got it. So off the record, did we kill Shareef?

C.J. looks at Danny then turns around and walks out of her office.

CUT TO: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
A car pulls up in front of a house. Toby gets out of the driver's side and
walks over
and opens the door for Andy, who is blindfolded.

TOBY
All right. Careful stepping out. [helps her get out of the car] There's a
street right
there. And there you go.

ANDY
If someone sees us, they're going to call the police.

TOBY
Well... I hadn't actually factored that into the plan, but if you'll just
come over here.
[leads her to the walkway] And... there you go. Go ahead.

Andy takes off the blindfold.

ANDY
You brought me to Jefferson Wyler's house.

TOBY
Yeah.

ANDY
Why?

TOBY
Everytime we drive past you say that it's your dream house.

They begin to walk up the walkway.

ANDY
It is.

TOBY
And every time the Congressman's had us over, you've said it was your dream
house.

ANDY
I wasn't lying.

TOBY
You told Jeff Wyler that if he ever put it on he market, you wanted to buy it.

ANDY
I do.

TOBY
Well, as it turns out, he was going to put it on the market, but he's not
anymore
'cause I bought it.

ANDY
You bought this house?

TOBY
Yeah.

ANDY
You bought this house?!

TOBY
Yeah, I did.

ANDY
How did you afford it?

TOBY
Well, I put together some money for the down payment by selling my soul.

He holds out his hand and Andy places her hand in his. He opens the door
and leads her
into the house. The walk into the LIVING ROOM where Toby opens the curtains.

ANDY
This is your house now.

Andy walks into the DINING ROOM. Toby follows her.

TOBY
Well, as a matter of fact, it'll...

Toby walks into the chandelier that is hanging from the roof.

TOBY
...it'll be your house if... if... if you say yes to this.

They walk down a step into the SUN ROOM at the back of the house.

TOBY
Um... will you marry me?

ANDY
Oh, Toby, you gotta tell me you didn't buy this house to...

TOBY
No, no. I mean...

ANDY
I thought you were just moving out of the apartment and wanted a...

TOBY
If we could just get back to the original question.

ANDY
Can you get the down payment back?

TOBY
You're saying no?

ANDY
Yeah, Toby. I said no many times. I mean this... is an incredible gesture,
but...

TOBY
I don't think you've noticed the things I've done to alter the behavior
that's troubled
you in the past. Giving up what you felt was a bachelor apartment is only
the most recent
of gestures which included eating salads.

ANDY
I have no problem with where we've lived or what you ate. I do, but I don't
care that much.

TOBY
Then why aren't you remarrying me?

ANDY
You don't really want to talk about this, do you?

TOBY
Yeah, I do. I thought you were just being cute. I just thought you were
making me
chase you as a punishment for the first marriage, and that was okay with me.

ANDY
I wasn't being cute, no.

TOBY
Why?

ANDY
You're just too sad for me, Toby.

TOBY
What?

ANDY
You're too sad for me. You're just sad. You bring the sadness home with you,
and
you're sad.

TOBY
I'm not sad.

ANDY
You are. I don't know if anything can change that, but I can't.

TOBY
I'm not sad. I take things seriously.

ANDY
I take things seriously, too.

TOBY
I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm saying...

ANDY
You're sad, and you're angry, and you're not warm. You take forever to trust
someone.

TOBY
Well... My father used to kill people for a living, so, generationally,
the Zieglers
are making lots of progress. I wouldn't worry about the kids.

ANDY
I do worry about the kids.

TOBY
Don't.

ANDY
Because instead of showing them that the world is for them, you're going to
be telling
them that they have to work hard in school so they can bone up for a life
of hopelessness
and despair.

TOBY
Wouldn't it be ironic if our kids were the only ones who were properly
prepared?

ANDY
Toby, I'm as serious as a person as you are, and I'm able to see the glass
as half full.

TOBY
Great! Half full, half empty? Can we at least agree it's not full yet?

ANDY
Well, this is what I'm talking about.

TOBY
That was a joke!

ANDY
You indicated that you wanted to talk about this seriously.

TOBY
Did you feel this way when we were married?

ANDY
Come on. I...

TOBY
I mean, it's not just now?

ANDY
Come on. I'm... sorry about all that. I'm only pregnant. Please, I take it
all back.

TOBY
Really. Hmm. Did you feel this way when we were married? That I was sad?

ANDY
No. I'm going to go sit in the car. My ankles are starting to...

TOBY
Did my friends feel like that?

Andy walks out of the room. Toby walks to one of the Fench doors and opens
it, looks
out and closes it back.

ANDY [OS]
Toby!

Toby runs OUTSIDE THE HOUSE where Andy is leaning against the car.

ANDY
My water broke.

TOBY
Okay.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY
Will is talking to Abbey.

WILL
We just wrote 3,900 words in five hours.

ABBEY
It's terrific so far.

WILL
Later, he quotes Cicero, Thomas Aquinas and Rudy Vallee in the space of two
pages.

ABBEY
How does he connect them?

WILL
Three people you've never heard of.

ABBEY
It's about creativity?

WILL
Well, he decided that's what he wanted to talk about. Now the trick is,
he's got to
not change his mind.

They reach the LOBBY.

BARTLET
Good! You're here! I want to make some changes.

ABBEY
Jed...

BARTLET
Look at you. There is no way you have three adult children.

ABBEY
You like the suit.

BARTLET
I do, but the neck...

ABBEY
What?

BARTLET
Eh, it seems empty to me. Attention should be drawn to it.

He pulls out a case and opens it up revealing a strand of black pearls.

ABBEY
Oh...

BARTLET
Nice job with the, you know, raising of the kid.

ABBEY
They're beautiful!

BARTLET
They're real, too. They can cut glass.

ABBEY
That's diamonds that can cut glass.

BARTLET
Aw, damn it, what are these, then?

WILL
Excuse me, you say you wanted to make some changes?

They go out to the DRIVEWAY.

BARTLET
Yeah. Get in the car. We'll do it on the fly.

WILL
Sir.

BARTLET
Get in the car...

WILL
What kind of changes do you have in mind, sir?

BARTLET
Small ones-- instead of talking about the internal muse, I want to talk
about the limits
of reason, and about passion and intuition in American life.

Abbey, Bartlet and Will get into the LIMOUSINE.

ABBEY
These are just gorgeous.

BARTLET
You can eat them, too. They're gumballs. Coop?

COOPER [DRIVER]
Shoot One. We're going to go.

WILL
Uh, the limits of reason and passion and intuition in American life.

BARTLET
Yes. Let's think.

The motorcade pulls off.

CUT TO: INT. LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
Leo is sitting at his desk looking at papers.

MARGARET
Here is the pen.

LEO
Look...

MARGARET
I've gift-wrapped the pen.

LEO
It's a good pen.

MARGARET
You're giving Zoey a pen.

LEO
It's not just a pen.

MARGARET
Does it do other things?

LEO
No. I meant it's a really good pen.

C.J. enters.

C.J.
He's meeting us in the upper press room.

LEO
He said his link was the pilot.

They start to the HALLWAY.

C.J.
Yeah. You know what he has?

LEO
Well, Shareef's pilot, who died in the crash, was Jamil Bari, who had a
Qumai passport
and is alive and American, and not named Jamil Bari, so he could have any
number of
things.

C.J.
Man, the things we can do.

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
You're giving Zoey a pen?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
Does it do anything?

CUT TO: INT. UPPER PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C.J. and Leo enter. They walk over to Danny, who is sitting at his laptop
with
sunglasses on.

LEO
Danny, C.J.'s going to talk to you for a second, and then you and I are
going to work
together.

Danny doesn't respond.

LEO
Danny?

C.J.
He's asleep.

LEO
What are you talking about?

C.J.
He was in Augsburg. He hasn't slept yet.

LEO
So here's the national security threat.

C.J. picks up a stack of papers and slams them on the table.

C.J.
Wake up.

DANNY
I heard every word you said. My covert skills are honed.

LEO
Good for you. Follow me.

CUT TO: INT. COPIER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
C.J., Danny and Leo enter. C.J. closes the door.

C.J.
We're at Threat Condition Bravo right now.

DANNY
Why?

C.J.
[to Leo] Why?

LEO
'Cause five Bahji sleepers we were watching disappeared.

DANNY
They disappeared?

LEO
Yeah. And it coincides with increased chatter we're hearing. You print we
did this
right now, and I'm worried what the five guys are going to do.

DANNY
Three days. And I get an exclusive on the sleepers.

LEO
Done.

C.J.
Thank you.

LEO
So you found the pilot?

DANNY
Special Ops in Florida. He had an American passport when he went to flight
school.

LEO
In Augsburg.

DANNY
Yeah.

LEO
The things we can do.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

AMY
Donna, I was just coming to see you. I love what you're wearing.

DONNA
You, too! I wasn't able to talk to Josh yet about the Wellingtons.

AMY
Yeah, you don't need to. They're off the list again. That's why I was coming.

They walk to the HALLWAY and out the DRIVEWAY.

DONNA
Okay, then. One less thing.

AMY
Josh was offended 'cause I called the list a windfall, wasn't he?

DONNA
I'm sure he's not.

AMY
I meant the list of candiadtes was good. I didn't mean-- aye, yi, yi. Why
does he take
these things this seriously?

DONNA
If it bothered him, he's forgotten it by now. Like the car that was supposed
to be here.

AMY
Well, come in mine.

A car pulls up and Amy and Donna get in it.

CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Andy is lying in the bed. Toby is standing in the corner behind the door
when the
doctor walks in.

DOCTOR
Andrea, what are you doing to me? We got schedules. We got bookkeepers.

ANDY
What happened?

DOCTOR
Nothing happened. You're having a baby. Two of 'em, as a matter of fact.

ANDY
But it was supposed to be ten days.

DOCTOR
Yeah, well, what do you know?

ANDY
Well, when am I going into labor?

DOCTOR
When are going in...? Andy, your water broke. You're having the babies
now. Now, this
isn't going to happen the way we talked about, but it is going to happen,
and it's
going to happen right now. You're at ten centimeters. Their heads are down,
so there's
no reason to do a C-section. Oh, hey, Toby. I'm sorry. I didn't even see
you there.

TOBY
[walking over] Is she going to be able to get the epidural?

DOCOTOR
No, we're going to tough it out.

Andy moans.

TOBY
And when you say "right now," what do you mean?

DOCTOR
We'll, you're going to see at least one of your kids in about 15 minutes.

ANDY
Toby...

Toby sits next to her.

ANDY
I can't believe... If I would've known this was going to happen today,
I never would've...

TOBY
No, don't. What... what are you talking about? D-don't worry about it.

ANDY
No. I know I hurt you back at the house. I can't believe you bought the house,
and I...

She starts to cry, but she has an contraction and begins to moan. Toby lifts
up his
hand and shows a rag wrapped around it.

TOBY
Bite my hand when it hurts.

CUT TO: EXT. GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY - DAY
The parents are standing up as the graduates are filing into their seats.

CUT TO: INT. GEORGETOWN BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
Bartlet and Will are standing at the top of a staircase making last minute
changes to
the commencement speech.

BARTLET
What do you think about using the Eudora Welty quote instead of the Gandhi?

WILL
Well, I think they both work, but since I wouldn't make anymore changes,
I'd stay
with Gandhi...

BARTLET
"You must be the change" - is that it? "You must be the change you wish to
see in the
world." Sounds too much like Eastern philosophy.

WILL
Well, it was bound to, sir.

BARTLET
'Cause Ghandi lived in India?

WILL
Yeah. Sir, this speech is about creativity and in my judgement, it's a home
run. Now,
what it isn't is a speech that will convince Zoey not to go to France
tomorrow.

BARTLET
Well, let's write that one.

AIDE
Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah.

The aide comes over and places on Bartlet.

GEORGETOWN CHANCELLOR
Are you ready, Mr. President?

BARTLET
Yeah. Thanks, Will, for the help.

WILL
Use the Eudora Welty, it's better.

BARTLET
Thank you!

ANNOUNCER [VO]
And now ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Josiah
Bartlet,
accompanied by the President of Georgetown University.

Bartlet and the Chancellor walk down the flight of stairs. "Pomp and
Circumstance"
can be heard playing. They walk out the double doors. The crowd applauds as
Bartlet
and the Chancellor walk out front. They talk to each other as they wave to
the crowd.

CHANCELLOR
I understand you're not using the TelePrompter.

BARTLET
Yeah, no. I've got it down here in this folder, and on some napkins in my
pocket.

CHANCELLOR
Okay. Listen, are you going to be all right with that?

BARTLET
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine. You know, unless something comes up.

CHANCELLOR
Uh, like what?

BARTLET
Well, for instance, I just realized I don't have access to my pockets
anymore. But,
you know, what are you going to do?

Bartlet laughs to himself. The crowd continues to cheer. Zoey pulls outa
camera and
snaps a picture of her father. He looks at her and she smiles back at him.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT

DONNA
You're here late.

AMY
I can't believe you're here. I was going to leave a note on your desk.

DONNA
I had a thing canceled, so I'm catching up.

AMY
I just wanted to let you know, the Wellingtons-- back on.

DONNA
For A-PEC?

AMY
Yeah.

DONNA
Ugh. It's going to be a problem.

AMY
I know, but Human Rights Watch, Amnesty-- we need their help three times a
week.
Is there a side meeting they can play a role in?

DONNA
There might be. That's a good idea.

AMY
You got a few minutes to work with me?

DONNA
Yeah.

CUT TO: EXT. NATIONAL ARBORETUM - NIGHT
It is dark out, and Charlie and Josh are walking through the park.

JOSH
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

JOSH
I need you to tell me now that you have some sense of where were going and
that we're
not... you know, spending the night here. That were not making camp.

CHARLIE
You were the one who said dig up the champagne and give it to her tonight.

JOSH
Yeah, but didn't I almost immediately take it back?

CHARLIE
No, I liked it. It was a good idea. Send her off knowing we're cool.

JOSH
You sure?

CHARLIE
No.

JOSH
It's pretty dark. Ohh!

Josh and Charlie have accidently stepped into a brook.

JOSH
Yeah, we're in a brook now.

CHARLIE
Good. I think it was near a brook.

JOSH
It's like I'm in 'Nam, basically. I'm in a rice paddy.

CHARLIE
Yeah, you'd have done well there.

JAMIE
Someone there?

CHARLIE
Hello?

JAMIE
Yeah, I'm a Federal Officer. Is someone there?

CHARLIE
Jamie?

JAMIE
Charlie?

CHARLIE
What are you doing here?

JAMIE
[into his cuff] P-3, Charlie Young's coming.

CHARLIE
You're kidding me.

JOSH
Josh Lyman. I'm with him. I'm going to stay here, though, 'cause you know...

Charlie leaves Josh standing in the brook. He gets out and walks across a
bridge through
bamboo, past a sign that reads "Paeonia Japonica." He sees Zoey sitting in
the dark
along the bank.

ZOEY
You're late.

CHARLIE
You're here.

ZOEY
It's 10:07. I've been here for seven minutes.

CHARLIE
Well, you drove in a sedan. I had to climb over the wall.

ZOEY
Shouldn't you have allowed for that?

CHARLIE
I didn't think you were going to be here.

ZOEY
Well, why'd you come?

CHARLIE
I was going to dig up the bottle and give it to you as a graduation
present. Why'd
you come?

ZOEY
Oh. To drink it.

CHARLIE
Oh.

ZOEY
I'm kidding. I came 'cause I thought you might, too. Though I have been
drinking it.

CHARLIE
You know there are people at a party that a radio station's throwing. At
that techno
place that looks like the end of the world. I think they went 'cause you
said you'd be
winding up there. I didn't come 'cause I thought you'd be here. I wasn't
trying to...

ZOEY
You don't want to have champagne with me?

CHARLIE
No, no. I do. I do, I just thought if I should call people and tell them...

ZOEY
You're such a good guy. You were raised in horror. What is it along the way
that made
you a good guy?

CHARLIE
I try to eat right. You know what's funny is, when I first saw the note, I...

Zoey leans over and kisses Charlie.

CHARLIE
We shouldn't do that. What's going on?

ZOEY
Nothing.

CHARLIE
Come on.

ZOEY
Don't ask me that now.

CHARLIE
I am asking you.

ZOEY
Nothing. Just, you know, a lot of things. Dumb stuff. Jean-Paul wants me to
take a
hit of ecstasy with him tonight.

CHARLIE
Okay, but your kids are going to have gills.

ZOEY
I don't care about that. I'm honestly-- I'm-I'm worried a little about my
father.
My leaving for three months isn't exactly going to do him any favors. And I'm
confused about you.

CHARLIE
Well, I can't advice you on that.

ZOEY
Why not?

CHARLIE
Because I think this is tonight, and tomorrow you're on the Concorde.

ZOEY
I deserved that. You think we could just sit here... and enjoy the night
for a while?

CHARLIE
Actually, I... I think it's a bad time in a person's life to stop showing
up at...
at places they say they're going to show up.

ZOEY
I should go to the party.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

Zoey leans over and kisses Charlie again. She hands him the bottle of
champagne then
gets up. Charlie watches her walk away.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
Leo, Nancy McNally, Fitzwallace and several other aides are meeting.

NANCY
Well, the FBI has got the crew of the container ship accounted for.

LEO
What are the rules in questioning foreign nationals?

NANCY
I think we can keep them for up to seven days, isolation, well-light room.

LEO
What's the well-light room for?

FITZWALLACE
Sleep deprivation.

LEO
All right. Let's go around the table one last time. Where are we with
this? What kind
of day has it been?

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
There are blue lights everywhere and techno music is playing. The crowd is
young.
Zoey enters the club.

RANDY
[into cuff] All right, she's clear.

Zoey hugs a girl she knows.

ZOEY
Hi.

Jean-Paul walks up.

JEAN-PAUL
Now is it my turn?

ZOEY
Hi, sorry I'm late.

JEAN-PAUL
Yes, where were you? You've been missed.

ZOEY
I was at the National Arboretum, if you can believe that.

JEAN-PAUL
As long as you're here now.

ZOEY
Can we talk for a minute?

JEAN-PAUL
Of course.

Jean Paul leads Zoey away to a seating area.

JAMIE
[into cuff] All right, station. I'm on the front door.

WESLEY
[into cuff] Okay. Molly?

CUT TO: EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
Molly is walking down a back alley.

MOLLY
[into cuff] Yes, sir. I've got 183 cars.

WESLEY [VO]
You counted the cars?

MOLLY
[into cuff] Yes, sir.

WESLEY
[VO] Okay.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT

DONNA
There's a side meeting, closed to the press, on agricultural concentration.

AMY
I was thinking more in the... human rights family.

DONNA
Mmm, a group session on displaced workers.

AMY
What about prison labor?

DONNA
No, but labor law enforcement, a joint DRL/USTR session.

AMY
Mmm... sold.

DONNA
There it is.

AMY
I'm not going to get an answer about what I said to Josh, am I? It's just
eating at me.

DONNA
I don't know why.

AMY
'Cause it's eating at him, and I don't know why.

DONNA
Really?

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
C.J. is standing behind the podium when she sees Danny in the upper press
room working
on his computer.

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
Yeah.

C.J.
What are you doing here? Why aren't you asleep?

DANNY
I really don't know.

C.J. begins to walk to the UPPER PRESS ROOM.

C.J.
Well, what are you writing?

DANNY
A volume of springtime haiku.

C.J.
Three days, Daniel.

DANNY
I'm filing in three days, I still got to write it.

C.J.
The President's speech was good this afternoon, didn't you think?

DANNY
You want to comment on a wire report that says the President lifted his gown
and groped
himself during the invocation?

C.J.
Yeah, that was a troubling moment, but he had to get his napkins.

DANNY
All right, then do you want to comment on a gulf stream jet flown by...?

C.J.
Madras research project. That's what we'll call it for a few days.

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
A slow pulsating song called "Angel" is playing. The camera parts through
kids dancing
to Zoey and Jean-Paul sitting on a couch.

	"You are my angel
	Come from way above..."

JEAN-PAUL
Well, three months is a long time. Maybe you just come for a few weeks,
we go to some
parties, and then you decide.

ZOEY
Maybe... but then I guess the whole point was to... was to check out... Going
just for
parties just doesn't seem...

JEAN-PAUL
The parties are at night. You can't check out during the day?

ZOEY
I'm sorry. We're having this conversation, and I'm just feeling a little
lightheaded.
I had champagne before and now I'm mixing it with this.

JEAN-PAUL
Well, lightheaded is good. It's better than the opposite.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT
Donna and Amy are sitting at Donna's desk drinking beer.

AMY
I understand why Josh may have been offended by what I said even though it
was
misinterpreted. What I don't understand is that both times we've spoken
about it,
it seemed like you were, too.

DONNA
No, I understood what you're saying. Josh worked for Hoynes for a long
time. There was
a reason.

AMY
He left him.

DONNA
And if you think that was easy, you're crazy. Josh doesn't leave people.

AMY
I get that he was close to Hoynes. What I don't get...

DONNA
You have to get Josh.

CUT TO: EXT. FRONT OF NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Josh is talking to Wesley. They're sitting on the hood of a car. Charlie is
pacing
in the background.

JOSH
We scaled the wall, we didn't hop it. It was like 30 feet tall. It was like
a castle
gate. We took it. Buzzards, wilderness life everywhere.

WESLEY
[into cuff] Someone give me a SitRep please, anyone.

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

ZOEY
I don't want to lie to you, but I, I don't want to... I'm sorry, I meant... I
don't
want to hurt you, but I shouldn't lie to you either.

A waitress walks by with a drink. Jean-Paul takes the drink and places it
in front of
Zoey, removing her other glass, which is empty.

ZOEY
Yes, I... I feel very strange.

JEAN-PAUL
You're drunk. Enjoy it.

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT

DONNA
His sister died in a fire while she was baby-sitting him. She tried to put
it out, he
ran outside. He went off campaigning, his father died. He wakes up in a
hospital and
discovers the President's been shot. He goes through every day worried that
somebody
he likes is going to die, and it's going to be his fault. What do you think
makes him
walk so fast?

Donna gets up and walks over to the mailboxes.

DONNA
Anyway, when you look at the list of replacements and said, "That's a
windfall," what
he heard was "Thank you Josh, you did it again. More for us."

AMY
You said you have to get Josh.

DONNA
Yeah. That was... I didn't mean to say that you don't... get him.

AMY
You in love with Josh?

Donna is reading a red book, then she closes it shut.

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

ZOEY
Did... you put ecstacy in my drink?

JEAN-PAUL
I put... a little bit. I put a half.

ZOEY
Wow. I kind of wish you hadn't done that.

JEAN-PAUL
You're not sick. This is how you're supposed to be feeling. Listen to the
music.

ZOEY
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm going togo to the restroom and put some water on my face.

Zoey gets up.

CUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT
Danny and C.J. are sitting in the front row press seats.

DANNY
I'm going to need the following five questions to start with. You want to
write these
down?

C.J.
I don't want to write anything down right now.

DANNY
Was Madras research retaliatory or preemptive? Were any allies in the Arab
world, or
Isreal for that matter, notified either before or after? How involved were
Congressional
leaders, and how involved will they be in the next few days?

C.J.
I don't know, but the answer to the last two questions will be the same.

DANNY
Especially in the absence of executive orders rendering them legal...

C.J.
There was an NSC decision directive.

DANNY
Does this create a precedent for future Madras reseach projects?

C.J.
That was four. What was the fifth?

DANNY
Does the President or his national security advisers fear attempts at
retribution?

CUT TO: EXT. FRONT OF NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Josh, Wesley, and now Charlie are sitting on the hood of the car.

JOSH
It's true that you adapt to the terrain. Of course after a little while I
just said
to hell with it, took my pants off.

WESLEY
[into cuff] Uh, Randy, does it look like she's thinking about leaving?

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

RANDY
[into cuff] Well, she's still in the restroom.

JAMIE
[into cuff] No she's not, I got her right here.

RANDY
[into cuff] You have her?

The girl who Jamie is following turns around. She's not Zoey.

JAMIE
No, check that, I'm wrong.

WESLEY
[VO] Oh, come on, people, let's get past the first day kinks.

RANDY
[into cuff] I think she's still in the restroom.

CUT TO: EXT. FRONT OF NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS
Wesley has jumped off the hood of the car, leaving Josh and Charlie.

WESLEY
[into cuff] Okay, I want a 20 on Bookbag right now.

Wesley begins to run into the club.

CUT TO: INT. NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

RANDY
[into cuff] I'll go into the restroom.

Wesley is now in the club.

WESLEY
[into cuff] No, no, keep your distance. Let her get pissed at me.

Wesley walks past Jamie and taps him on the arm. He walks up to Randy when
a waitress
walks by.

WESLEY
[to waitress] Excuse me. I'm with the Secret Service. Do you work here?

WAITRESS
Yeah. Something wrong?

WESLEY
No,no. Would you mind going into the ladies' room for me, please, and checking
to see
if anyone's in there.

WAITRESS
Yeah.

WESLEY
Thank you.

The waitress puts down her tray and walks into the restroom.

WESLEY
[into cuff] P2, Molly, did she come out back? Are there people back there?

Wesley looks up and sees a back door ajar. The waitress comes out of the
restroom.

WAITRESS
No.

Wesley runs into the RESTROOM. He checks and sees that all the stalls are
empty.

WESLEY
[into cuff] P2, Molly, did she come out back? Are there people out
there? Molly, are
you reading this? Molly?

Wesley walks back to the NIGHTCLUB.

WESLEY
[to waitress] This is the fire alley?

WAITRESS
Yeah.

Wesley pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs. He exits to the ALLEYWAY.

WESLEY
[into cuff] P2, Molly, what's your position?

Wesley walks out and sees Zoey's panic button on the ground. He picks it
and begins
to run down the alley. He turns a corner. We see Molly lying on the ground
in a pool
of blood. She's shot square between the eyes.

WESLEY
[into cuff] Bookbag's been taken. She's been taken and I have an agent
down. We're
black. Go to black.

CUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

NANCY
FBI field office have all 98 members of the Agile crew at Sheridan Federal
Prison for
interrogation.

Fitzwallace begins to laugh.

NANCY
It's not funny. Apparently the captain is scared to death. His manifest only
says 45
containers. He swears it's a typo.

LEO
Well, if it turns out we closed the Port of Portland because of a typo,
it's only
going to fuel Margaret's insanity. I'm going to go home for a few hours. Call
me if
something happens.

The doors to the Situation Room open and Ron Butterifeld appears in the
doorway.
Ron is breathing hard. Leo walks over to him.

LEO
Ron?

RON
We have a situation. We're up at black, and procedurally, the Chief of Staff
is told
before...

LEO
What happened?

RON
Zoey Bartlet is missing, and there's a dead agent at the scene.

Leo absorbs the information. A black and white photo of Zoey's face flashes
on the
screen. We see Leo walking through the BASEMENT HALLWAY. A black and white
photo of
Zoey holding her hand in front of her face flashes on the screen. Leo is
now in the
WEST WING HALLWAY. He begins to run past THE ROOSEVELT ROOM. A black and
white photo
of Zoey's eye flashes on the screen. Leo runs through THE OVAL OFFICE and
out to the
PORTICO. As he runs to the Residence, the camera zooms in closer to his face.

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.
FADE TO BLACK.
