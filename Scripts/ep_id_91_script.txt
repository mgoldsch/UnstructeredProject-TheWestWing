TEASER

NEWSCASTER #1 [VO]
At this hour the White House has not...

FADE IN: TV SET SHOWING PRESS BRIEFING

NEWSCASTER #2 [VO]
Stepping in to fill the gaping hole left by...

We move to another set showing a reporter in the street addressing the camera.

NEWSCASTER #3 [on TV]
A stunning demonstration of the continuity of Constitutional government.

We pan across and see many reporters in front of the White House, each in front
of a camera, each telling of the current crisis. We see that a black limo
is parked in front of the main entrance. Two men step out as a guard opens
the door to the White House. They walk in and we move to yet another monitor
and see a reporter speaking. The headline reads "CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS".

REPORTER [on TV]
In a solemn, hastily arranged ceremony, Speaker Glenallen Walken was sworn
in early this morning, as President.

We pan across to another TV set showing the press briefing and President
Bartlet speaking to the public.

BARTLET
Accordingly, I have decided to temporarily hand over my duties as President.

      HOUR SEVEN

REPORTER [on TV]
...a six term Congressman from Liberty, Missouri, who ascended to the
Speaker's office with the retirement of Speaker Jim Hohner. A staunch
supporter of the military and of veterans...

We see Will walking through the Communications office while reading something
in his hand.

REPORTER [cont.]
...he's been a strong proponent of a sound fiscal policy...

Will walks in to TOBY'S OFFICE, where Toby and Josh are watching the news
broadcast. Donna walks in behind him.

JOSH
"Sound fiscal policy"? Proposing a $200 billion capital gains tax cut?

REPORTER [cont.]
...an outdoor enthusiast, he has frequently defended the rights of gun owners.

JOSH
He's opposed to waiting periods on grenade launchers.

DONNA
Where's he gonna sleep? The Bartlets aren't moving out of the White House,
are they?

WILL
There are thirteen bedrooms in the Residence.

DONNA
So he's gonna be in what, a guest room?

We turn back to the TV to see President Walken step up to the podium as
President Bartlet steps back.

DONNA [OS]
Does he get a portrait? Every President gets one, right?

Ginger walks in the door with papers in her hand.

GINGER [OS]
Even if he's only been the President for a few days?

WILL
I don't think there's a minimum occupancy requirement.

Josh gets up and moves toward the TV set.

GINGER [OS]
What about a Presidential Library? Does he get a library?

TOBY
He's not going to be here that long.

We focus now on the TV and the press conference. President Walken is answering
questions and President Bartlet is standing in the background. He looks
obviously worried.

REPORTER [on TV][OS]
...serve as President while his daughter was missing, and do you think he
should have?

WALKEN
I've answered that question. Brian?

JOSH
He looks small.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA

We hear Leo talking in the background. He, CJ, Carol, SPECIAL AGENT MIKE
CASPER, and another FBI man are talking in one of the cubicles.

LEO
And the note still hasn't shown up on Al Jazera or Sahafa?

C.J.
Not yet.

LEO
It will.

C.J.
Do we release the ransom note?

CASPER
If we don't, they will.

LEO
State has been talking to Islamabad about the prisoners named in the ransom
note. They've pledged their full support.

FBI MAN
We're requesting the President's approval to issue a BOLO on the Bahji
sleeper cell we lost track of yesterday.

C.J.
A manhunt?

FBI MAN
We release their names and photos - maybe someone spots them.

C.J.
If we prematurely connect them with Zoey's kidnapping, we deputize every
nut with a gun rack.

FBI MAN
They disappeared twenty four hours before her kidnapping; it's not premature.

C.J.
You want vigilantes with baseball bats assaulting Arab Americans?

FBI MAN
I want Zoey Bartlet back.

LEO
I'll take it to him.

Leo and Casper walk out of the cubicle together, talking as they go.

CASPER
The French kid's awake.

LEO
Is he answering questions?

CASPER
No. He's asking them. He wants immunity.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Margaret is walking toward a door with several pieces of paper in her hand
as Leo walks out of it. She follows him, talking as they move through the
lobby and to another door.

MARGARET
The French premier, the Russian Prime Minister, the Presidents of Brazil,
Mexico, the Israelis.

LEO
What are all these people doing here?

MARGARET
They work here.

LEO
It's 5:30 in the morning.

MARGARET
I'll make sure they know.

They go through the doors as Margaret continues.

MARGARET
The Democratic leadership wants to come over.

LEO
All of them?

Josh walks around the corner and joins them on the way to the Oval Office.

JOSH
You tell him the leadership wants to come over?

LEO
Who called?

JOSH
House Minority Leader, Minority Whip, Senate Minority Leader, Whip, McLean,
Wyznee, Franklin, Caucus Chair...

LEO
I'm going to need a bigger office.

They walk into the Outer Oval Office. Debbie is standing at her desk.

LEO [cont.]
Is he still here, Debbie, or has he gone to the Residence?

DEBBIE
[walking to the door] Here.

LEO
[to Josh] Tell them it's gonna be a while.

JOSH
They're not gonna be happy.

LEO
When are they ever?

DEBBIE
Leo.

LEO
I'll be right back.

Leo walks into the Oval Office. There are several people standing around
the President's desk.

DEBBIE
Mr. McGarry.

LEO
Mr. President?

Some of the people move aside and we see that President Walken is standing
behind the desk.

WALKEN
Come on in, Leo.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE
FADE IN: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - MORNING
      HOUR EIGHT

Bartlet is standing at the window as Abbey walks in and speaks to him.

ABBEY
Hey.

BARTLET [OS]
I thought you were sleeping.

ABBEY
Anything?

BARTLET [OS]
No.

ABBEY
What time is it?

BARTLET [OS]
It's almost 6:30.

ABBEY
[sighing] Oh. They gave me something.

BARTLET
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

ABBEY
Hmm. [pause] Girls coming?

The camera pans and we see Bartlet's face through the reflection in the
glass. He nods.

BARTLET
They'll be here in a few hours. You want me to call down for some coffee?

ABBEY
[heavily] I had a dream. I was in Zoey's bedroom. At home. It was like it
was when she was small with the bed my grandmother gave. Remember the pine bed?

BARTLET
Of course I do.

ABBEY
She was little again...maybe...five or six...and I was holding her.

She looks up at Bartlet. He reaches down and grabs her hand. They stand
in silence.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY

C.J. is heading down the hall toward the press briefing room. Carol, along
with Agent Casper and several other FBI men, is walking behind her.

C.J.
 How do I look?

CAROL
Like you slept in your clothes.

They walk into the briefing room as several reporters begin clamoring for C.J.

REPORTERS
C.J.! C.J.! C.J.!

We focus on the TV set on the wall and we C.J. walk to the podium and begin
the briefing.

C.J.
Good morning. I have with me members of the FBI team who have taken a lead
role in this investigation. The FBI has opened a '7A' - that's a missing
persons file - and has assigned Zoey Patricia Bartlet a control number:
7A WF 83429. The 'WF' stands for 'Washington Field Office'. I'll take a few
questions before turning it over to Agent Casper. Mark?

MARK
How long will Speaker Walken be President?

C.J.
Until President Bartlet sends a second letter to Congress indicating he's
prepared to resume his duties. Steve?

STEVE
CNN is reporting the Fifth Fleet has been ordered into the Persian Gulf. Is
there any reason to believe this might be the work of a foreign government?

C.J.
We're still in the early stages of this; it's to early to speculate who's
involved. Chris?

CHRIS
Paramedics on the scene have indicated drugs were involved. Does Zoey Bartlet
have a drug problem, and did she have any reason to disappear?

C.J.
There's a Secret Service Agent with a bullet in her head. I think the FBI
feels pretty comfortable in calling it a kidnapping.

CHRIS
C.J.!

C.J.
And no, Chris, Zoey Bartlet doesn't have a drug problem. Agent Casper.

REPORTERS
Agent Casper! Agent Casper!

CASPER
At 3:17 am, we received what we believe to be an authentic communication from
Ms. Bartlet's kidnappers demanding the release of three convicted terrorists
being held by Pakistan and the immediate removal of all American forces from
Qumar and Saudi Arabia. We're also issueing a BOLO for five individuals last
seen in the Portland area who are wanted for questioning in connection with
possible terrorist activities. They are Yemeni nationals Faruk Salam and
Ammat Badir, Tanji Nassiliw and Masood Sheik Kadallah, both Saudis...

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Josh, Toby, Will, and Donna are watching the briefing on TV.

JOSH
I'm guessing Burka sales are gonna take a little dip this afternoon. What
are working on?

WILL
Remarks.

JOSH
For what?

WILL
Walken's address to the nation.

JOSH
He's addressing the nation?

WILL
No, but he'll have to.

DONNA
They didn't have much.

JOSH
Oatmeal carrot granola?

DONNA
[to Toby] Ginger find you? Andy called. Just checking in. Asked you to call
her at the hospital.

JOSH
How are the twins?

TOBY
Fine.

JOSH
You have photos yet?

TOBY
No. Something came up at work.

Josh smirks.

WILL
What is that?

DONNA
Eggwich.

WILL
I'm sorry.

 JOSH
I think we made a mistake.

DONNA
What?

JOSH
Letting the President step aside.

WILL
Have you been watching CNN, MSNBC? Even FOX is treating it as a seminar on
the resiliency of the Constitution.

JOSH
The President's daughter is probably tied up in the back of a gas station. We
have no idea how this is playing.

WILL
He showed he's a leader, nobly embracing his own flawed humanity.

JOSH
Lincoln and Kennedy had children who died. They didn't take a sabbatical.

TOBY
Who's been calling?

JOSH
Congressional leadership.

TOBY
Lincoln never got a ransom note from Jefferson Davis. He's putting country
before family. I'd carpet bomb Mecca to get my kids back.

JOSH
What if they like Walken better? What if he seems more presidential? What
if they want Walken to stay?

WILL
In a few days, President Bartlet turns the second letter over to Congress.

JOSH
What if it doesn't take a few days? What if it takes a few weeks, a few
months? What if she's never found? [pause]

CAROL [prelap]
I sent one of the kids...

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY

C.J. and Carol are walking through the hallway towards her office. Danny is
following them.

CAROL [cont.]
...over to your apartment for clothes.

DANNY
C.J.

C.J.
Not today, Danny. Please.

DANNY
Yes, today.

C.J.
[to Carol] A Donut, maybe, or some toast.

DANNY
Pulling out of Qumar, the release of Bahji prisoners. I have to ask...

C.J.
No, actually, you don't.

DANNY
Is there a connection between the assassination of Abdul Shareef and the
kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet?

C.J.
We have a deal.

DANNY
That was before the President's daughter...

C.J.
A deal, Danny. Three days.

DANNY
In exchange for an exclusive on five Bahji sleepers the FBI just outed to
every news outlet in the known universe. Is there a connection between the
assassination of Abdul Shareef and the kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet?

C.J.
It's only been a few hours...

DANNY
Is there a connection between the assassination of Abdul Shareef and the
kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet?

C.J.
Damn it, Danny! I have no idea! What do you want from me?

DANNY
I'm filing the story today.

C.J.
It'll get buried.

DANNY
No, it won't. Does the White House wish to comment to accusations that
President Bartlet order the assassination of a senior official of a friendly
government?

C.J.
I don't know.

DANNY
Well find out. You got a couple of hours before I post it online.

He turns and walks out of the office.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

NANCY McNALLY
The Pakistanis are prepared to stage a release of the Bahji prisoners. We
film it, put it on CNN, send it to Al Jazeera.

LEO
What does it get us?

CASPER
A little more time.

We see that Leo, Agent Casper, Nancy McNally, and the rest of the national
security team are sitting around the table. The doors open and everyone
stands as President Walken comes into the room.

GUARD
Ten-hut!

ALL
Good morning, sir. Good morning, Mr. President.

Walken sits.

WALKEN
Stand down, everybody.

They all sit.

WALKEN
Where are we?

FITZWALLACE
The Washington carrier group will be in position in three hours.

WALKEN
Have we had any further communication from the kidnappers?

CASPER
No. But the driver's license used to rent the minivan from the Kinko's
led us to an apartment complex in Baltimore rented to the same Shahab
Kaleel. Neighbors say two Arab men were living with Kaleel. No one's seen
them for three days.

LEO
What about the apartment?

CASPER
Mail, photographs, numerous fingerprints, even a passport.

WALKEN
They didn't try to cover their tracks?

CASPER
No, sir. They don't care if we know who they are. They don't plan on being
alive in a few days.

WALKEN
What do you want to hit, Admiral?

FITZWALLACE
Kazir training camps.

NANCY
The Qumaris say those are religious schools.

FITZWALLACE
There terrorist training camps masquerading as religious schools. We traced
Kaleel to Zachari Faruk, leader of the camps.

WALKEN
They close to anything?

NANCY
Villages, hospitals, a food distribution center.

FITZWALLACE
We're suggesting AGM-88 HARMS. We'll hit what we're aiming for.

NANCY
This is a long-term ally in a highly volatile region.

FITZWALLACE
Bombing Tripoli stopped Libya.

NANCY
It's more likely to strengthen the resolve of the terrorists and topple a
moderate Islamic regime.

LEO
If we bomb the camps, don't the kidnappers murder Zoey Bartlet?

WALKEN
Or it sends a message: kill her or don't, the United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

SLATTERY
Our European allies are going to go crazy. They have billions tied up in
oil and natural gas pipelines in Qumar.

WALKEN
Screw the Europeans. They've had years to get the Qumaris to get their house
in order. What are the chances Zoey Bartlet's still alive?

CASPER
Hard to say. But I think yes, she probably is. They'll want to milk this
for all it's worth.

WALKEN
[standing up] Get your people in place, Admiral. We don't go today unless we're
provoked. Find Zoey Bartlet and find her fast, but so help me, if she turns
up dead, I'm going to blow the hell out of something and God only knows what.

He leaves as Nancy and others stare at him in disbelief.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - ELEVATOR - WHITE HOUSE
      HOUR NINE

Leo is inside the elevator. The doors open, he steps out, and heads for the
Residence. He enters the Residence and goes to the bedroom door. He speaks
to the Secret Service Agent there.

LEO
He's expecting me.

He turns as the agent opens the door and he sees Charlie sitting in a chair
opposite the door.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Abbey and Bartlet are sitting on the couch.

BARTLET
The kid's asking for immunity?

LEO
We gave it to him. The dealer's an Algerian friend of his from Paris. They
haven't found him yet. Jean Paul thought he was spiking her drink with Ecstasy,
not GHB.

ABBEY
Anything else from the kidnappers?

LEO
Not yet. But the FBI has traced a driver's license to an apartment in
Baltimore. They have names and descriptions of two other suspects and a
wealth of information to work off of.

In the background, a phone starts ringing.

BARTLET
We need to stall and give the FBI more time.

LEO
[nodding] Yeah.

BARTLET
You're already doing it.

Leo nods. Abbey gets up to answer the phone.

ABBEY
Excuse me. [into phone] Hello?

BARTLET
She's been on the phone for hours. People never know what to say. She just
ends up consoling them.

LEO
Everyone's calling. 22 heads of state, the Queen, the Vatican.

BARTLET
I guess people aren't excited about the idea of our children being in play
now. They gave her a number, Leo. I saw it on CNN. My little girl's a case
number now. Five digits.

LEO
Danny Concannon is going to run the Shareef story.

BARTLET
What?

LEO
The Shareef story. Danny's running it. Asked if we wanted to comment on it.

ABBEY
[into phone] But we all have to believe it's going to be all right.

BARTLET
No. No comment. So what's Walken going to do, cry havoc and let slip the
dogs of war.

LEO
I'm really not at liberty to discuss that with you, sir.

BARTLET
Right, no. I'm sorry of course.

LEO
[standing up] I should get back. Charlie is out in the hall.

BARTLET
What? I sent him home hours ago.

LEO
He didn't go.

Bartlet stands up and goes out into the hall. He looks over at Charlie as
Leo walks away.

BARTLET
I thought I sent you home.

CHARLIE
[standing up] You need something, sir?

BARTLET
Nah. We're good. Sit down. [They both sit.] Jean Paul gave the FBI the name of
his dealer. [looking over at Charlie] Yeah, I want to kill him, too. You really
should go home. You work for the President. He's going to need you down there.

CHARLIE
I work for you. Someone else can show him where the Xerox paper is.

BARTLET
You do a lot more than that.

CHARLIE
Thank you, sir, but I'd prefer to stay here with you.

MARGARET [prelap]
It's the-the brown...

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo is looking for something on his desk and is frustrated because he can't
find it. Margaret is trying to help him.

LEO
No, I know. I had it here. I had it here three minutes ago. I was writing
notes in it...

MARGARET
It's under there.

LEO
...and now suddenly I don't know if I put the paper...

MARGARET
It's right...it's right by the...

LEO
You know, if the desks were a little neater I might be able to find something.

MARGARET
It's right by...

LEO
I know where it is. I had it with the NEC week-ahead. Now I can't even
find that.

Margaret leans over, picks something up from his desk, and hands it to
him. He looks surprised at her having found it so quick.

LEO
Did you move it?

C.J. comes into the office.

C.J.
Excuse me, Leo? Danny's filing in an hour. Have you had a chance to take it
to the President?

LEO
I was just up in the residence. The answer is 'no'. We do not comment.

C.J.
The residence?

LEO
Yeah.

C.J.
I meant President Walken.

LEO
Margaret.

Margaret enters from her office.

LEO
Everybody ready to go?

MARGARET
They're gathering.

LEO
Bring it up with Walken at the meeting.

He walks out of his office and Josh starts talking to him. The rest of the
senior staff begins walking with them toward the Outer Oval Office.

JOSH
You see this?

LEO
Yeah. Any word on the new speaker.

TOBY
It's going to be Haffley or Mitchell. I'm betting it's Haffley.

WILL
Oh, man, Haffley?

JOSH
It'll be Mitchell. Even Republicans think Haffley's a fascist. I also hear
rumors Walken plans to nominate a Vice President.

LEO
He won't.

JOSH
He can.

LEO
He won't!

They all enter the Outer Oval Office.

DEBBIE
Everybody here?

LEO
Yeah. How's he doing?

DEBBIE
He has a dog.

Debbie knocks on and opens the door of the Oval Office. Walken is inside
talking with some of his staff from his Congressional office.

WALKEN
...basically just to... [to senior staff] Yeah, come on in.

Everyone begins walking in.

WALKEN [cont.]
Don't worry everyone, I haven't reupholstered the furniture yet. Y'all know
Steve from my office. Bill Bradley, Anne Peterson, Tim Safford. Everybody,
sit. Do y'all have assigned seats?

C.J. sits down timidly on the arm of the couch, next to Walken's dog, Bess.

TOBY
Uh, no, sir.

WALKEN
[seeing C.J.] Oh, that's just Bess. Just shoo her on off there. She'll... Get
off, Bess. Get down, girl.

C.J. pushes Bess off of the couch and sits down in her place.

WALKEN
Good doggie. How does this usually go, Leo?

LEO
Trade and Commerce are coming at 1:00 to discuss whether we should close
the markets tomorrow.

STEVE
That's not a bad idea.

TOBY
We close them, the terrorists win.

STEVE
Last thing we want to see Monday morning is the DOW down 600 and the dollar
tanking.

TOBY
Closing the market only hurts the dollar.

WALKEN
Well, they're coming by at 1:00. How are we doing on a VP?

JOSH
We're still vetting candidates.

WALKEN
In case you guys haven't noticed, I'm one prime rib dinner away from sudden
cardiac arrest. I don't want the Secretary of Agriculture being named as
the next President of the United States.

WILL
Senate Pro Tem.

Everyone looks quizzically at him.

WILL
The Senate Pro Tem is next in the line of succession.

WALKEN
Well, Republican leadership is sending me their ideas. You might want to
round up some on your own. If I'm still here on Tuesday we are going to get
into this.

Bess begins barking.

WALKEN
Bess, knock it off, damn it! Leo, what's next?

Leo looks at C.J. as she begins.

C.J.
Danny Concannon is doing a story alleging we assassinated Abdul Shareef.

WALKEN
How are his sources?

LEO
He's got it.

C.J.
He's looking for a comment.

WALKEN
I suppose throwing him in leg irons and locking him in the basement of the
Capitol wouldn't do any good.

Bess starts barking again.

WALKEN
Damn it, Bess. Tim? Take her out for a pee, will ya? Her leash is over on
my chair. I'm sorry. Where were we?

LEO
Shareef.

WALKEN
Yeah.

LEO
We shouldn't comment, sir. Not while Zoey Bartlet is missing.

STEVE
Well, we need to get out in front of it, release it before it breaks in
the Post.

TOBY
Release what? That we violated the neutrality act to covertly assassinate
an official of a friendly government?

STEVE
Must not have been too friendly if you decided to shoot him.

WILL
Sir, acknowledging the assassination destroys a century's worth of progress
toward international law.

STEVE
You guys didn't think of that before you did it?

JOSH
It wasn't supposed to become public.

STEVE
Yeah, well, you tried that before. How'd it work out on MS?

WALKEN
Release it before Concannon has a chance to file the story.

C.J.
Sir, we convinced Danny to hold the story several days ago. Undercutting
him would be going back on our agreement.

WALKEN
Your agreement. Release it.

CUT TO: EXT. - RESIDENCE - ENTRANCE - DAY

Several limos and SUVs pull up to the entrance of the residence. Bartlet and
Abbey are waiting at the door. As the limos park, we see ELLIE BARTLET in
the first. Abbey runs over to meet them. The second pulls up and ELIZABETH
BARTLET WESTIN, along with her husband and two children, get out. The three
girls come up and hug Abbey around the neck. Liz's son and husband walk over
to Bartlet. He hugs his grandson and shakes hands with his son-in-law.

DOUG WESTIN
Jed.

BARTLET
Doug.

DOUG
How are you holding up?

Bartlet and Doug look over and see the girls hugging and crying.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Danny is walking down a corridor towards C.J.'s office.

C.J.
Call the Oval, see if he has a moment to go over a draft of the press release
we were discussing a few minutes ago.

Danny enters the office as Carol leaves.

CAROL
Hi.

Danny walks in.

DANNY
You looking for me?

C.J.
The White House doesn't want to comment for your story.

DANNY
Okay.

C.J.
Danny?

DANNY
Yeah?

C.J.
Post the story now. [emphatically] Right now.

DANNY
Thanks.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Some moving men are carrying a couch down the hall. Josh walks into the
Communications Office.

JOSH
What's with Bekins?

TOBY
The Visigoths laid siege to the Mural Room.

JOSH
Atwood and his guys?

      HOUR THIRTEEN

TOBY
Yeah.

JOSH
I guess we should be happy they didn't evict us.

TOBY
I'm sure it was discussed.

JOSH
[sighing] Will's working in there?

TOBY
Sleeping, I think.

Josh walks over to Will's office and knocks on the glass.

JOSH
Walken scheduled a press conference?

TOBY
He's got to respond to Danny's story.

JOSH
What's he gonna say?

TOBY
I have no idea?

Josh knocks on Will's window again.

JOSH
Yeah, I've narrowed it down to about fifty names.

TOBY
That's what? Everyone over 35 with a pulse?

Will peeks through the blinds at Josh and Josh motions for him to come out
of the office.

JOSH
Bachman.

TOBY
We're talking Norman Thomas with a necktie.

Will comes out of his office rubbing his eyes as the all head into Toby's
office.

JOSH
I'm pretty sure Norman Thomas wore a necktie, but scratch Bachman. [to Will]
I've got some VP names.

WILL
Great.

Will's hair is ruffled and Josh points it out to him. He tries to straighten
it as they continue talking.

JOSH
Hayes.

TOBY
Fair Labor Standards Act?

JOSH
Yeah. Graham?

WILL
No support in the Northeast. Plus he rides that scooter which is a little...

JOSH
Sheats?

TOBY
Too...

JOSH
Yeah.

WILL
You getting a lot of calls?

JOSH
Only a couple of hundred. They all start out by saying how sorry they are
about Zoey and then spend ten minutes trying to work their name and the vice
presidency in into the same sentence.

Donna walks in and hands a jacket to Josh.

DONNA
Leo's looking for you. [to Toby] Are they going home today?

TOBY
Who?

DONNA
The twins.

JOSH
I was gonna ask about the twins.

TOBY
They go home tomorrow.

JOSH
Anyone else coming to the Auto Da Fe?

TOBY
We weren't invited.

Donna, seeing Will's hair, begins to smile.

WILL
What?

LEO [prelap]
President Walken has assured me that he has no intention...

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

Leo is meeting with the Democratic leadership.

LEO [cont.]
...of pushing any partisan agenda.

WOMAN
Walken can spend his entire presidency channel surfing in the Lincoln
Bedroom. You said to the country, Democrats can't handle security.

MAN #1
If you want to save a spotted owl, vote Democratic. If you want your kid
saved, sorry, we'll be doing the crossword.

LEO
President Bartlet is protecting kids by ensuring that decisions are made
based on relevant intel, not on a distraught father's clouded emotions.

WOMAN
If any emotions are clouded, Leo, its yours. Let's face it, Leo. You've
always been too close to Bartlet.

MAN #2
It's your job to buck him up, Leo. To help him make the tough decisions. The
presidency isn't a vanity exercise.

LEO
Who's doing electoral math on the back of a napkin in the middle of a
national crisis?

WOMAN
You single-handedly ended the Imperial Presidency.

MAN #1
You've elevated Walken and the Republicans. You've made them into genuine
players on the world stage.

LEO
I didn't elevate them. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 did. And I'm
not prepared to think about politics while we're under terrorist attack. The
Republic comes first. That's why Truman wanted the Speaker third in line.

WOMAN
Truman wanted the Speaker third in line because he used to drink bourbon
with Sam Rayburn.

LEO
The only thing I find extraordinary about that is that a member of
the executive branch actually wanted to share a drink with a member of
Congressional leadership. [standing up] Thank you for coming by to show your
concerns. And I'll be sure to pass them on to President Bartlet.

He walks out of the room and into his office. Josh follows.

JOSH
Those guys are on our side? They're not wrong, you know. We should be thinking
about the political ramifications. We should be polling on this.

LEO
No.

JOSH
The Republicans will.

LEO
No!

JOSH
Okay.

 Josh leaves the office.

LEO
[pause] Margaret.

Margaret steps into the office.

LEO
Get me Angela Blake.

MARGARET
In New York?

Leo nods his head.

LEO
Yeah.

C.J. [prelap]
So we have no idea what's going to be...

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY

C.J. and Carol are walking along toward the briefing room.

C.J.
...in his statement?

CAROL
He had his staff print it up.

C.J.
Great. Hopefully, we're not declaring war on Uraguay.

CAROL
What's all over your butt?

C.J.
What?

CAROL
Looks like cat hairs or something.

C.J.
Oh, for God's sake.

CAROL
Did you get a pet?

C.J.
No, it's President Walken.

CAROL
Is he molting?

She begins trying to get the hair off of her skirt. While she is, Walken
and his staff walk up the other hall, also going to the press room.

WALKEN
Back home, you have to pay extra for that at the Kit Kat Club.

C.J.
I got something on my skirt.

WALKEN
They ready for us?

C.J.
 Yeah.

CAROL [OS]
I'll go settle the room. [she leaves]

WALKEN
My tie straight?

C.J.
No. Would you like me to...?

WALKEN
[nodding] Thanks.

C.J. sets her stuff down and begins to straighten Walken's tie.

WALKEN
Remarkable how that Post story hit the wires right before we released it.

C.J. continues straightening his tie without looking him in the face.

WALKEN
Bad luck for us, I guess.

C.J.
There you go.

WALKEN
You know I'm not the enemy. The things that unite us are far greater than
things that divide us. We both believe in democracy, preservation of American
values, protection of our citizens in a sometimes hostile world.

C.J.
Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness?

WALKEN
Yeah.

C.J.
That's what's in your statement?

WALKEN
Something like that.

C.J.
Don't look down at the front row when you answer questions. Look back at
the cameras.

They walk into the briefing room as we--

CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh walks out of his office and into Donna's cubicle area to watch the
press conference on the TV.

NEWSCASTER [on TV]
...now live to the White House where President Walken will take questions
regarding the administration's assassination of Qumari defense minister,
Abdul Shareef.

We see that Toby, Will, and Donna are also around the same TV set as Josh.

REPORTER #1 [on TV]
Doesn't the murder of a foreign official undercut our moral authority to
condemn human rights violations in China and Africa?

WALKEN [on TV]
We live in the real world. Our moral values system only works if everybody
plays by the same rules.

REPORTER #2 [on TV]
But didn't it violate the Neutrality Act protecting citizens of friendly
nations from prosecution?

WALKEN
Terrorists aren't nations,...

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

Liz, Abbey, and Ellie are sitting on the couch watching the press conference.

WALKEN
...and the Neutrality Act doesn't give a free pass to people who support
the murder of women and children.

REPORTER #3 [on TV]
...violating international law?

Abbey, deep in thought, gets up from the couch and leaves the room.

WALKEN [on TV]
International law has no prohibition against any government, superpower
or otherwise, targeting terrorist command and control centers. And Abdul
Shareef was a walking command and control center.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS

WILL
Damn. Good answer.

REPORTER #4 [on TV]
You stated that as Speaker, you knew of and supported the assassination. Do
you now regret that support?

WALKEN [on TV]
My only regret is that we only got to kill the bastard once.

WILL
The UN's going to go crazy.

DONNA
I'm sorry, but he seems...I don't know...

JOSH
Presidential?

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SUNROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bartlet is sitting in a chair watching the press conference.

REPORTER #5 [on TV]
If something were to happen to you, the Presidency would fall to Senate Pro
Tem Joseph Furman, who is 90. Are you going to nominate a Vice President?

WALKEN
Insuring an orderly succession is important, but right now, all of us here
are just focused on getting Zoey Bartlet back for her parents and for the
nation. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

He steps away from the podium and offscreen as Bartlet turns of the TV. Liz
comes into the room.

LIZ
Dad?

He doesn't answer. She comes closer.

LIZ
Dad? Did Mom know?

FADE TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - KITCHEN

Abbey and Ellie are making themselves lunch. Bartlet walks in with his coffee
cup in his hand.

BARTLET
 Ellie, can you give us a minute?

ABBEY
We're making lunch.

BARTLET
Why don't I call downstairs, get 'em to send something up?

ABBEY
I don't want anymore people in here. There are already too many people in
our lives.

Liz walks in and over to the table to get lunch for her kids.

LIZ
Are the kids' noodles ready?

ELLIE
Yeah, and I'm cutting up some fruit.

ABBEY
It isn't true, is it?

BARTLET
I'm sorry you had to hear about it on television.

ABBEY
Why should today be any different?

BARTLET
Abdul Shareef had nothing to do with what's happened to Zoey.

ABBEY
You don't know that.

BARTLET
It was debated and discussed and agonized over for weeks.

ABBEY
Debated and discussed? I'm here. I don't remember that.

BARTLET
It was a difficult decision!

ABBEY
Made by you, not us.

The girls are obviously tense about the argument that's going on.

BARTLET
I did what I thought was necessary.

Abbey comes around from the table she was at and leaves the room with
her lunch.

ABBEY
Your decisions, Jed, not ours.

Liz leaves the room behind her mother. Bartlet walks away from kitchen and
sits at the dining room table. Ellie brings him his coffee up, sets it down
in front of him, and hugs him around the neck.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY

Margaret walks to Leo's door and opens it. She walks in and calls to Leo.

MARGARET
Leo?

      HOUR SIXTEEN

MARGARET
Leo!

Leo, asleep on the couch, wakes and speaks with Margaret.

LEO
Huh? What time is it?

MARGARET
It's almost 5:00.

LEO
I told you to wake me up at 4:00.

MARGARET
You needed the rest.

LEO
What are you now, my mother?

Margaret sets down a cup of coffee on the table in front of Leo

MARGARET
The Secretary of State called.

Leo takes a drink of coffee before answering.

LEO
I'll bet he did.

MARGARET
He's getting some pretty irate calls on the Shareef thing. And Josh called. The
new economic advisor forecasts are in.

LEO
And? Great! Just great.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Will, followed by Ed and Larry, are walking through the hallway looking at
the economic advisor forecasts.

WILL
How bad?

LARRY
Our guys are starting to freak out at the number of unemployment.

WILL
I thought it was just a blip.

LARRY
Last week it looked like a blip, now it's starting to look like a pattern.

ED
Consumer confidence numbers tanked.

They meet up with Josh.

ED [cont.]
New housing sales dropped 1.2 percent, nonresidential construction was down
2.6 percent. And, out of nowhere, the ISM index fell below 50.

JOSH
But duct tape futures are up, right?

ED
Actually, Commerce doesn't really break it down by...

WILL
He was joking, Ed.

JOSH
At least the numbers won't get much play in the press room right now.

LARRY
If the economy is headed into a recession...

JOSH
No, no, no! We don't ever use that word around here.

LARRY
What word, recession?

JOSH
No!

WILL
If we say it, it gives it credence.

LARRY
What should we call it?

JOSH
I don't care. Call it a boat show or a beer garden or a bagel.

ED
So if it is a...bagel, the Fed thinks it's going to be a mild bagel.

WILL
That'll be comforting to the millions of Americans who'll lose their jobs.

Donna walks in and hands Josh a folder.

DONNA
Take the Haffley photos off the dart board, boys. Elvis is in the building.

JOSH
Oh, come on.

LARRY
Who's in the building?

DONNA
The Republican leadership.

JOSH
Who we got?

DONNA
Haffley, Connelly, and Mitchell.

JOSH
The unholy trinity.

LARRY
What are they doing over here?

WILL
Picking a new Speaker, we think.
CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Through the doors of the Roosevelt Room, we see the group continuing down
the hall.

JOSH
Is that Duke?

DONNA
Yeah?

JOSH
Oh, please don't let it be Duke. He hates me.

WILL
Tomlinson?

JOSH
He hates me, too.

ED
Jim Arkin?

JOSH
Arkin really hates me.

DONNA
Are you detecting a pattern here?

CUT TO: INT. - COMMUNICATIONS BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

The group is staring through a window in the Communications bullpen. Steve
walks up to the door on his way to the Roosevelt Room.

STEVE
Hello, Josh. Everybody.

JOSH
Hey, Steve. How's it going?

STEVE
Good. You all want to...come in for a second, say hello?

JOSH
No, that's okay. Thanks.

Steve turns to leave, but Josh calls him back.

JOSH
Hey, Steve? Don't get too comfortable in there. You guys won't be back for
three or four more terms.

Steve smirks, then leaves as Larry's face becomes concerned about something
he has seen on the TV set he has been watching.

LARRY
Hey, guys...

Neither Josh nor Will see what he is seeing, but Donna comes over and she
becomes concerned as well.

JOSH
Do we have any hidden cameras or tape recorders or something in there?

WILL
Not since the mid 70's.

DONNA
Josh?

Josh and Will come over and see what is on the TV. We see that it is a new
report showing the aftereffects of a bombing. The headline reads "TURKEY
AFTERMATH".

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

The same broadcast is seen on a television in the Situation Room.

SLATTERY
Istanbul is reporting a truck loaded with TNT drove into the lobby of the
Thalasso Center Cinema in Antalya.

LEO
How many dead?

SLATTERY
At least 14 Americans, a group of Italian tourists, and 60 Turks.

WALKEN
How many Americans were military personnel?

FITZWALLACE
All of them, Mr. President. The theater was full of sailors on shore leave
from the Raleigh.

WLAKEN
Anyone claiming responsibility?

NANCY
Al Jazera is saying they received a fax from the Bahji.

WALKEN
So, nothing from the kidnappers?

CASPER
No, sir. But we're making progress on the three suspects in Baltimore.

WALKEN
Why have we not heard from them?

CASPER
We don't know, sir. It's probably time for us to encourage them to clarify
their position.

FITZWALLACE
Maybe they just did.

WALKEN
What about the five sleepers?

CASPER
No, sir.

SLATTERY
We're hearing a lot of displeasure from the  Middle East over the Shareef
assassination.

WALKEN
Well, if the Arabs are mad at us, we must be doing something
right. Dr. McNally.

NANCY
Sir, this would be the first time in our history that we have violated the
sovereign soil of an ally.

WALKEN
Admiral.

FITZWALLACE
Our people are at DEFCON Alpha, waiting for your go.

WALKEN
What would be involved?

FITZWALLACE
12 F-14B Tomcats and eight F/A-18E Super Hornets off the George
Washington. Then the Marine 3/7 will drop 1,100 Special Ops forces in to
clean it up.

NANCY
So, a bombing and an invasion?

FITZWALLACE
We'll be in and out in three days.

LEO
We bomb Qumar and the kill her.

Everybody drops silent for a moment.

WALKEN
They're going to kill her anyway. [pause] When do you want to go, Admiral?

FITZWALLACE
It'll take Special Ops nine hours to get in position. On your order, we'll
be over the targets in ten. 6:30 our time tomorrow morning.

WALKEN
Do you want to tell the President, Leo, or should I?

LEO
Thank you, but I'll do it.

WALKEN
Get the Qumari Ambassador over here. Let him know we're going to bomb his
country.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE ELEVATOR - DAY

Again, Leo is inside. He steps out and heads for the Residence. When he
walks in, Bartlet is standing at the window. He walks over to him.

LEO
Where is everybody?

BARTLET
Getting dressed. We're going to St. Joseph's. Father Hughes offered to
celebrate a private mass for the family.

LEO
The Secret Service is letting you go?

BARTLET
I still have a little pull around here.

Charlie enters and speaks to Bartlet.

CHARLIE
Excuse me, sir. The cars are ready.

BARTLET
[to Leo] Ellie came too, did I tell you?

LEO
No.

BARTLET
Mm-hmm.

LEO
That's great.

BARTLET
All the things we wanted to do, Leo. All the things we believed in and wanted
to fight for.

LEO
Sir...

BARTLET
He's going to bomb, isn't he?

LEO
Yes, sir, he is.

Bartlet stares out the window reflectively as Leo turns and walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT

A few employees are still at their desks. We see and hear a TV broadcasting
a story about Zoey and the Shareef assassination.

NEWSCASTER [on TV]
Approximately three hours ago, President Walken announced the United States'
conspiracy to murder Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef. He mysteriously
disappeared...

We see other TV sets on as Donna leaves her cubicle and goes into Josh's
office. Josh is typing at his computer.

DONNA
I though Leo told you to go home?

JOSH
Yeah.

DONNA
Come on, get your coat.

JOSH
There's some things I want to finish up. You go ahead though.

DONNA
Harold says people have been leaving stuff by the fence for Zoey all day
long. Thought I might walk by on my way home, check it out. Josh. Come on.

CUT TO: INT. - TOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Toby is sitting at his desk writing on a legal pad. A news broadcast can be
heard in the background. Leo walks in and stands in front of the TV.

TOBY
Leo?

LEO
They were just boys - oldest was only 24.

TOBY
Are we going to respond?

Will walks in from his office.

WILL
Any word on Zoey?

LEO
I need you to start two speeches.

TOBY
I already started working on the first one today.

LEO
Go home tonight, get some rest. Come back fresh in the morning - both of
you. I need you at your best tomorrow.

TOBY
You going, too?

LEO
Yeah, uh, absolutely. I'm beat.

He turns and walks out of the office. Will steps further into the office.

WILL
Why two?

TOBY
One if they find her alive, one if they don't.

CUT TO: EXT. - STREET - NIGHT

The presidential motorcade is driving down the street headed for St. Joseph's
Church. The cars arrive at the church. Secret Service Agents can be seen
opening the doors, letting the family out of the car. They all walk together

A map of the Middle East can be seen displayed on the screen. Leo comes in
and sits at the table.

Oh, my God.

Abbey is taking her communion.

The map is now showing the flight paths of the aircraft on their way to Qumar.

We again see the map of the flight path.

CUT TO: INT. - ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH - NIGHT

Bartlet gets up from his seat and goes forward to take his communion. As he
