TEASER
FADE IN: EXT. - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
      SUNDAY 11:34 PM

A car is driving through a parking garage. After a few turns, it parks and LEO
gets out. He walks over to another parked car where ANGELA BLAKE is waiting.

ANGELA BLAKE
I'm not unwittingly participating in the commission of a felony, am I?

LEO
How was your flight down from New York?

BLAKE
Mercifully short.

LEO
Sorry about the Foggy Bottom theatrics.

BLAKE
No, it takes me back to the illicit affairs of my misspent youth.

LEO
So, where are we?

BLAKE
Tomorrow's New York Times CNN poll has his approval rating up to 76%.

LEO
And in ten days?

BLAKE
His numbers are gonna crater. Not level off, crater, like a failed Mars
probe. Today it's, "He lost his daughter. What a shame. We're pulling
for him." and in two weeks, it'll be, "I don't want a President I have to
pull for."

LEO
He did what was constitutionally appropriate. He upheld his oath.

BLAKE
If you want a constitutional debate, you should call the Dean of Columbian
Law. Our guy quit when things got tough. Josh must be going nuts.

LEO
He thinks we need to put a poll in the field.

BLAKE
White House can't be caught putting a poll in the field. [pause] Okay. I'll
call you when it's done. We need photos, Bartlet on the phone with world
leaders, conferring with military advisors, looking resolute.

LEO
He won't do it.

BLAKE
You've been a good friend to him, Leo, but you have other responsibilities. The
people need to believe that when he comes back he'll be able to govern
effectively, even if he can't secure the safety of his own family. They need
to know he's willing to sacrifice his own child's life for his country.

LEO
Would you be?

BLAKE
I wasn't stupid enough to run for President.

Leo turns to leave and heads back to his own car.

BLAKE
Leo?

He turns.

BLAKE
If she dies, his approval ratings will go through the roof.

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT: LEO'S OFFICE - DAY
      MONDAY 6:00 AM
      HOUR 30

We see Leo sitting in his chair facing the window. He is teary-eyed but only
slightly startled when Margaret opens the door and comes in.

MARGARET
Secretary Berryhill's here.

LEO
Two minutes, then bring in the Ambassador.

Margaret returns to the door and indicates for SECRETARY OF STATE LEWIS
BERRYHILL to come in. He does.

LEO
Good morning, Lou.

BERRYHILL
Leo.

LEO
You've been briefed?

BERRYHILL
When does it start?

LEO
I'm just waiting for word from Fitzwallace.

BERRYHILL
Doesn't it remind you a little of the Japanese on December 7th?

LEO
You wanted us to warn them we were coming so they could shoot back at us?

BERRYHILL
I didn't want us to do it in the first place.

Margaret knocks on the door and shows in the QUMARI AMBASSADOR UMAR USEF.

LEO
Mr. Ambassador. Thank you for coming so early.

He and Leo shake hands.

USEF
Thank you.

LEO
You know the Secretary of State.

USEF
Yes.

He and Berryhill shake hands.

BERRYHILL
Good morning.

Leo indicates for them to sit.

LEO
Please.

They all sit around Leo's desk.

USEF
I want to express the Crown Princes outrage at the brutal assassination of
his cousin and his sadness with the events of the last days. Please extend
our sympathies to the President Bartlet and his family, and let him know
that the prayers of all Qumaris are with him.

LEO
Oh, I don't think all Qumaris.

USEF
If any of our citizens are involved in this tragedy, I can assure you,
we will do everything within our power to bring them to justice.

LEO
Including the mullahs?

USEF
If the United States has sufficient evidence to implicate...

LEO
Your government actively supports the Bahji. In addition to stoning adulterers
and banning anything written after and including the Guttenberg Bible,
they preach the overthrow of our government and violence against our citizens.

USEF
We are an Islamic nation. Our kingdom depends on the support of the Imam...

LEO
You allow Kazir training camps to operate within your borders...

USEF
We allow Kazir religious schools...

LEO
...and you support radical fundamentalism throughout the Muslim world.

USEF
You don't have Christian missionaries trying to convert our youth?

LEO
Not government sponsored missionaries with explosives, manuals, and weapons
training.

Margaret knocks on the door, enters, and hands Leo a note.

MARGARET
Excuse me.

BERRYHILL
Mr. Ambassador, you can't expect us to stand idly by while so many of your
citizens are intent on murdering our citizens.

USEF
It is difficult to listen to you characterize the assassination of a member
of our royal family as standing idly by.

LEO
[standing up] We're bombing the Kazir training camps in Tamir and Lani.

USEF
When?

LEO
Now. And we're following it up with ground forces to detain and interrogate
any suspected terrorists.

USEF
Thank you for informing us in such a timely manner. [leaving] We are one of the
only friendly governments you have left in the region that is growing younger,
poorer, and more radical every day. If you undermine us, who do you think
will take our place? Please tell the President that I have a daughter, too.

He leaves the office.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - STAFF LOUNGE - DAY

We here a phone start ringing and we see that Josh is asleep on the couch
in the staff lounge. He wakes up and grabs the phone. He opens and groggily
answers it.

JOSH
Hello...No, I'm awake....I, uh, already read the papers, showered. I'm in
the office. Can you hang on for one sec?

He bends down, puts the phone on the table, and puts his shoes on. He sits,
up, rubs his eyes, and then runs his hands through his hair several times. He
picks the phone up again.

JOSH
Hey...No really, I already went for a run.

He gets up and opens the door and we see Amy Gardner standing in front of
the door talking on her cell phone, obviously to Josh.

AMY
[into phone] Nice track suit.

They both hang up as she comes inside.

AMY
Could have said I woke you. I wouldn't have thought less of you.

JOSH
Sleeping is...I don't know, lacks a certain masculine...something.

AMY
Your virility is tied to exhaustion?

JOSH
You want coffee?

He looks over and sees her pulling a coffee cup out of her bag.

JOSH
You brought coffee.

AMY
It's been awhile but I don't remember fatigue improving...

JOSH
You hungry? You want to head down to the mess, grab a...

She pulls out a wrapped bagel.

JOSH [cont.]
...couple bagels. You got a shower and a freshly ironed shirt in there?

They both sit at the table. Josh grabs his coffee cup.

JOSH
Black?

AMY
That soy chai, or whatever you drink is affecting your already addled brain.

She turns to see the TV that Josh is staring at.

AMY
Would you stop staring at the TV?

JOSH
Anything new on Zoey?

AMY
No. [pause] How long have you been in here?

JOSH
I don't know, since about 3:00.

AMY
Did you see the morning papers? We have a new Speaker.

She shows him the paper. The Headline reads "HAFFLEY SEIZES THE HOUSE".

JOSH
Oh, God, Haffley? He'll be passing out pelts and slabs of bison in the
cloakroom.

AMY
Roll Call has the GOP leadership resuming its committee schedule tomorrow
whether Zoey's back or not.

JOSH
Aside from adding to our nation's greenhouse gas problem those committee
hearings are meaningless.

AMY
Word on the street is, Atwood has Walken meeting with Republicans today
without any Democrats.

JOSH
Yeah, they were over last night, too.

ABBEY
Were any of you there? Well they weren't talking site selection for the
Republican National Convention.

JOSH
Damn it, Haffley?

AMY
They're gonna start legislating again, Josh. Partial birth, federal funding
for family planning clinics...

JOSH
Walken does anything by executive order, we overturn it as soon as we get back.

AMY
A cheering thought to the women who's lives are ruined in the meantime. Do
you even know when you'll be back?

JOSH
Not exactly. Damn it.

AMY
If Walken's holding partisan pep rallies in the West Wing, leak it.

Her beeper starts going off. She picks it up while still talking to Josh.

AMY
Embarrass Atwood into backing off. [looking at her beeper] Oh, God.

CUT TO: INT. - GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY

We see Toby and Andy sitting in one corner of the lobby each with a twin in
their arms.

ANDY
Hey. You look good with a baby in your arms.

TOBY
Actually, my arm's asleep.

He gets up and starts walking with the baby still in his arms.

ANDY
I'm sorry about what I said on Saturday. It's a beautiful house.

TOBY
I want you to have it.

ANDY
No.

TOBY
For our kids.

ANDY
I can't.

TOBY
Well, I don't want it.

ANDY
Toby...

TOBY
You can't live in a one-bedroom condo with twins.

ANDY
I found a house on D Street. It's a three-minute walk to the Rayburn
Building. [pause] Has something happened?

They notice the news report on the television. Toby walks over, still carrying
Huck in his arms, and we see that C.J. is giving a briefing.

C.J.
At approximately 11:10 Zulu time this morning, 12 F-14B Tomcats and 8 F-A18E
Super Hornets flying off the U.S.S. George Washington in the Persian Gulf,
bombed three strategic targets in Qumar.

CUT TO: INT. - BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

C.J. is briefing the press.

C.J.
American intelligence confirmed that each of the sites was a Kazir terrorist
training camp. President Walken ordered the attack yesterday evening and he
was notified...

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

Bartlet, Abbey, Ellie and Liz are watching the briefing on TV.

C.J. [cont.]
...at 6:30 this morning that all 20 planes had successfully completed their
missions and were on their way back to the George Washington. President
Bartlet was notified after the mission was completed. He was in the White
House Residence with Mrs. Bartlet where he will remain throughout the day...

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Several people, including Leo, Walken, and Fitzwallace, are in the room going
over stuff after the bombing. C.J.'s briefing can be heard in the background.

C.J. [cont.]
...tracking progress on the investigation of his daughter's
disappearance. Mark?

MARK
Qumar is an American ally. Are they participating or assisting in this
bombing campaign in any way?

C.J.
Ambassador Umar Usef was informed of the mission this morning but the Qumaris
are not participating. Steve?

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

STEVE
Is there concern that the bombing may force the kidnappers to kill or in
any way harm Zoey Bartlet?

C.J.
I don't speak on there behalf so I can't say what they will or won't do. Bob?

Abbey gets up, tearfully, and leaves the room. Liz gets up and follows her.

BOB
Has there been any indication of resistance or retaliation from the Qumari
people?

C.J.
No, not as of this time...

Bartlet shuts off the TV. Ellie finally gets up and leaves as well, leaving
Bartlet by himself.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA -DAY
      MONDAY 7:30AM
      HOUR 32

Josh walks up to Donna in her cubicle.

JOSH
You see?

DONNA
Yeah, I saw. You have 132 phone messages.

JOSH
Half of them want me to switch my long-distance carrier.

DONNA
There'd be at least as many faxes if we had a fax.

JOSH
We don't have a fax?

DONNA
The FBI boosted it for evidence.

JOSH
Okay, so we're not gonna return all of those. See if Leo's around, would you?

Josh walks into his office and sees his new intern, RYAN PIERCE, sitting in
a chair in front of his desk.

JOSH
Hi.

RYAN PIERCE
Hi.

Josh looks at him for a minute and then walks back out. Donna is dialing
her phone.

JOSH
There's that guy in my office.

DONNA
That's Ryan. Says he works for you. Did you forget to tell me something?

JOSH
He said he works for me?

DONNA
That's what his pass says, too.

Josh walks back into his office. He shakes Ryan's hand as he comes around
his desk.

JOSH
Hi. Josh Lyman.

RYAN
Ryan Pierce. I didn't know if I should come in, what with everything that's
going on.

JOSH
Yeah, it's been pretty crazy here.

RYAN
I figured if there was a problem, somebody would have called or...

JOSH

Okay, who are you?

RYAN
Ryan Pierce.

JOSH
Right, no, I got that part. I mean, who are you?

RYAN
Leo didn't tell you?

JOSH
Leo McGarry. Wait here.

He leaves his office and heads toward Leo's office.

DONNA
Leo's in his office. Am I being passed over?

JOSH
What?

DONNA
If your going to bring someone in over me, you can at least have the common
courtesy...

JOSH
I don't even know who that guy is.

He sees C.J. as he is going through the hall.

JOSH
C.J., you get the felling that we don't know what the hell's going on around
here anymore?

C.J.
What?

JOSH
You hear anything about Steve Atwood trying to push a legislative agenda
while Walken's in the Oval?

C.J.
No.

JOSH
Okay.

He walks through the Communications office and into Toby's office. He begins
monologue-ing to Toby, who stares at him while he does.

JOSH
Word is, the Republicans are coming back over today. Is Leo invited? Are
you? I think they're planning to start legislating. Partial birth, school
vouchers, maybe even Anwar. They've got the votes on the Hill, the only
reason they haven't moved on Medicare again is because they know we'd veto.

TOBY
Did you get any sleep last night?

Will walks in.

WILL
Haffley. Can you believe it?

TOBY
We can filibuster in the Senate.

JOSH
Not on partial birth or tax cuts.

WILL
What are we talking about?

JOSH
Getting our asses kicked.

TOBY
You going to Leo? Wait for me.

As he's walking out of his office, he hands Will a writing pad.

TOBY
Will you read this. I'll be right back, okay?

JOSH
A once-in-a-lifetime chance to slam dunk your agenda and solidify your
base? Plus, Walken's going to ride off into the sunset as the presumptive
Republican nominee. You think Atwood wouldn't love to cinch that with
partial birth?

They walk through the Roosevelt Room and into Margaret's office.

TOBY
Three new Supreme Court Justices? A few new weapons systems?

JOSH
Ah, I'm not being paranoid. [to Margaret] Is he in there?

With out waiting for her to answer, Josh goes to the door of Leo's office
and knocks on the frame.

JOSH
You got a minute?

LEO
Not really.

JOSH
Rumor is the Republicans are going to start legislating. Pick issues where
we can't sustain a filibuster and ram 'em through.

LEO
They won't.

JOSH
They're meeting secretly again to today.

LEO
It wasn't secret yesterday. They were in the Roosevelt Room.

JOSH
To plot a strategy.

LEO
This isn't the grassy knoll, Josh. Walken isn't going to take the offer...

JOSH
You've asked him?

LEO
[to Toby] You been drinking his Kool-Aid?

JOSH
We need to leak it to the press. The GOP are using the cover of a national
crisis to impose a radical right-wing agenda.

Leo turns to walk back to his desk.

LEO
Josh...

JOSH
The President needs to sign the second letter and take his office back. Then
we nominate a strong VP. Once he's confirmed, if the President still needs
to recuse himself, he can step aside.

LEO
Go through all this again?

JOSH
Please, we should at least take it to the pre...

Leo has obviously had it listening to Josh ramble on.

LEO
Damn it, Josh! The man's child is missing, probably dead. He doesn't give
a damn about politics right now.

Leo again turns to leave his office.

JOSH
That's why we have to.

LEO
Where are we on the Vice President?

JOSH
I'm...working...

LEO
I want three names on my desk by 7 am tomorrow.

Josh turns to leave, but turns back.

LEO
Toby?

JOSH
Leo.

LEO
I swear to God, Josh, if you...

JOSH
No, it's not about that. There's a guy in my office, says he works for me,
knows you. Ryan...

LEO
Ryan Pierce, right. He's your new intern.

JOSH
I thought we decided I wasn't going to have to have interns anymore?

LEO
No, you decided.

Margaret walks to the door and waits to speak to Leo.

JOSH
All right. Pierce is...? Is he a Pierce Pierce?

LEO
Yeah.

Josh turns and leaves the office.

MARGARET
They're ready for you.

LEO
Okay.

Leo heads out of his office and Toby goes with. They walk to the door of
the Outer Oval Office as they talk.

TOBY
I know it's kind of crazy, but Josh may not be wrong about...

LEO
We did this to ourselves. Now we have to live with it.

TOBY
They're bombing Qumar?

LEO
We're bombing Qumar. How are you and Will coming on the speeches?

TOBY
We've started working.

LEO
The second one, for if Zoey doesn't...I don't want the President to know I
ever asked you to...

TOBY
Yeah. No, of course. Hell, if I could even figure out how to write it. How's
he doing?

LEO
Not so good.

TOBY
He knows if there's anything...

LEO
He knows.

Leo turns and walks into the outer office.

CUT TO: INT. - WILL'S OFFICE - DAY

Will is at his desk reading and editing the speech that Toby gave him. The
TV is on, but the volume is too low to understand what is being said. Through
the window, we see Toby walking through the Communications bullpen. He walks
into Will's office and over to his desk. He looks over at the TV.

TOBY
What's that?

WILL
Congress.

TOBY
What are they doing outside?

WILL
Praying for Zoey.

TOBY
So...what?

Will reads from the pad he has been writing on.

WILL
[reading] 'Today we affirm this solemn truth, America is the strongest
force for freedom the world has ever kno...' So strong, you can trigger a
constitutional crisis by dosing the First Daughter's vodka gimlet.

TOBY
Give it back.

WILL
'Anyone who dares invade the sanctity of America's house will be caught,
prosecuted, and punished with all of America's might.' Meaning what,
exactly? We're going to bomb their prison cells? You're treating Zoey like
an abstraction. It needs to be a man, humbly supplicating himself...

TOBY
Supplicating? He's not going to stand in front of the cameras and rub
gravel through his hair. We need a tone of defiant leadership, a return to
Commander-in-Chief. What's the alternative? Admitting he was off licking
his wounds, but now he's ready to come back and take the nuclear launch codes?

Will hands him the paper he has been writing on.

WILL
I was just trying a few...

Toby takes it and looks at it.

TOBY
[reading] 'I thank the Lord that Zoey is back in her mother's arms, yet our
nation still grieves.'

WILL
Well, it's a new and difficult time. He needs to acknowledge that we've all
been visited by our own mortality.

TOBY
'I know I am not alone in think how fragile is the safety and security
we all take for granted.' Your leading with failure. What kind of message
is that? If we go two lines without using the phrase 'unimaginably large
military arsenal', we're out of our minds.

WILL
You want me to start on the second one?

TOBY
You're already doing it.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

President Walken is meeting with several people including Leo, Secretary
Berryhill, Admiral Fitzwallace, Agent Casper, and Steve Atwood.

H
The Qumari have not issued a statement, yet. I'm sure they're trying to shape
an appropriate response somewhere between a hunger strike and declaring war.

MAN
Good luck.

WALKEN
No writing yet on other Arab capitals?

BERRYHILL
It's early yet.

LEO
What about the UN?

BERRYHILL
China's onboard, but Syria is currently on the Security Counsel. They will
need hand-holding. I'll go up this afternoon.

WALKEN
Admiral.


FITZWALLACE
C1-41s will have the entire regiment on the ground in about six hours.

LEO
Any casualties?

FITZWALLACE
A Marine CH-53 transport helicopter was hit by enemy RPG fire, leaving the
landing zone a few minutes ago.

Walken looks devastated at the news.

FITZWALLACE
Two pilots and four crew members are KIA.

WALKEN
Agent Casper?

CASPER
Still no communications from the kidnappers. We have detained and interrogated
51 members of the mosque the suspects had been attending.

BERRYHILL
The Saudis have agreed to assist us in interviewing the suspects' families
in Saudi Arabia.

CASPER
They are not going to allow us to conduct the interrogations, be we can have
someone present.

STEVE
It's better that they do it, anyway.

BERRYHILL
Why is that, Mr. Atwood?

STEVE
They're not as squeamish.

LEO
What about the five Bahji sleepers up in Portland?

CASPER
No. Nothing.

A secretary knocks on and opens the door. She comes in and speaks to the
President.

SECRETARY
Excuse me, Mr. President. Mr. Steinholtz is here.

WALKEN
Thank you, everybody.

They all get up and leave except for Steve and Leo. Walken gets up and goes
behind his desk.

WALKEN
Deficit projections don't look great. We're gonna need a stimulus package.

LEO
Or revenue enhancements.

WALKEN
Significant tax cuts. Reduction in discretionary spending. You have something
on your mind, Leo?

LEO
So, now what?

WALKEN
You have a suggestion?

LEO
This office isn't always about doing something. Most of the time it's about
not doing something.

WALKEN
Steve, give us a minute.

Steve leaves.

WALKEN
What's your point?

LEO
You're meeting with Republican leadership again without any Democrats or
Cabinet members present?

WALKEN
What are you accusing us of?

LEO
You weren't elected to this office.

WALKEN
Neither were you!

LEO
I have a responsibility to President Bartlet and...

WALKEN
Don't lecture me about the responsibilities of this office!

LEO
Then start acting like you understand them!

WALKEN
If you're uncomfortable serving as my Chief of Staff, Leo, then feel free
to recuse yourself until I'm gone.

LEO
Thank you, sir.

He walks away, into his office, and shuts the door.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - DAY

Leo is walking down the hallway toward the residence. He walk through the
doors, past Charlie, and into the next room.

BARTLET
We started this, Leo.

LEO
This isn't about Shareef.

BARTLET
You're right; it's not. It's about our allowing situations in these countries
to develop in the first place.

LEO
I'm not gonna let you do this.

BARTLET
We choose the order and certainty of petty desperates over the uncertainty
and chaos of developing democracies.

LEO
Shareef ordered the assassination of women and children. He wasn't a
nationalist or a fledgling Democrat. He was a cold-blooded murderer.

BARTLET
Six more American boys are dead.

LEO
And that doesn't make you angry?

BARTLET
[yelling] Of course that makes me angry! [pause] "The ultimate weakness of
violence is that it is a descending spiral. Returning violence with violence
only multiplies violence, add deeper darkness to a night already devoid
of stars."

LEO
Dr. King.

BARTLET
I'm part of that darkness now, Leo. When did that happen?

LEO
Dr. King wasn't wrong. He just didn't have your job.

FADE OUT.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY
      MONDAY 3:30 PM
      HOUR 39

Josh is sitting at his desk working on the VP. There is a bulletin board
with several pictures tacked to it. Ryan is sitting across from Josh.

RYAN
Need any help?

JOSH
No.

Ryan gets up and goes to the wall to look at Josh's stuff.

RYAN
Harvard, huh?

JOSH
Yeah.

RYAN
Cum laude.

JOSH
Don't be too impressed with that. Harvard gives those out like paper place
mats. Summa's the hard one. I knew one person that got summa that year. She
was my girlfriend. [pause] Where'd you go?

RYAN
Go?

JOSH
Uh, you graduated from college, right?

RYAN
Yeah...uh, Harvard.

Donna walks in with some stuff in her hands.

DONNA
Josh, the vetting files on the...

RYAN
My dad went there, too, my sister...my Uncle Bunky.

DONNA
Bunky?

RYAN
Yeah. Ridiculous, huh?

C.J. walks in with stuff in her arms.

C.J.
Atwood gave a quote to the Times.

DONNA
You're a Pierce? Pierce Bedroom in the Residence. That's you?

RYAN
My great-great-grandfather.

JOSH
Has Toby seen this?

C.J.
Found you first.

C.J. turns to leave. Josh gets up after her.

DONNA
What's it say?

Josh hands it to her as they walk toward Toby's office.

RYAN
[to Josh] Hey, you know a Elliot Cabot? He would have been there around
your time.

JOSH
No, I don't think so.

RYAN
I knew his little sister, Perrin, pretty well in fact.

JOSH
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

RYAN
You know Hamilton Pew? Ham Pew?

DONNA
I don't get it.

They walk through the Communications bullpen and to Toby's office.

JOSH
Where's Toby?

BONNIE
He went down to the mess.

RYAN
Ham's squash team was eight-and-0 in '89. All Ivy three years in a row.

JOSH
I wasn't much into squash. I was more of a Crimson guy.

DONNA
Crimson?

JOSH
The Campus newspaper.

RYAN
Yeah, that figures.

JOSH
What's that supposed to mean?

RYAN
Nothing. That's great.

JOSH
Are you implying that I didn't have a social life?

RYAN
You said you had a girlfriend, right?

JOSH
I had a lot of girlfriends.

DONNA
Really?

RYAN
You guys always walk so fast?

He suddenly trips and falls.

JOSH
Yes.

RYAN
[getting up] I'm okay.

JOSH
Where'd you spend your free time, one of those finals clubs? Oh, let me guess,
the Spee? Tasty Pudding?

RYAN
Pudding is not technically a final.

They reach the mess and Josh spots Toby.

JOSH
Toby. Steve Atwood in the Times. It's already on the website. [to Ryan]
It's perfect; you're one of those guys who used to harass me on the way
to the library on Friday nights, drunk out of your minds, wearing those
ridiculous red chinos.

Toby sets the food tray he had in his hand down as he and Josh leave the mess.

TOBY
You and me.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

A messenger comes in and hands an envelope to Debbie.

DEBBIE
Thanks.

She opens it and sees what's inside. She gets up and goes to the door of
the Oval Office. She knocks on the door and enters. Walken is on the phone.

WALKEN
Your son's sacrifice for his country, for the safety and security of us all,
will not soon be forgotten, sir. ...I-I appreciate that, sir. You and your
family will be in our prayers tonight. ...Thank you, sir.

He hangs up the phone and pauses before speaking to Debbie.

WALKEN
How many more?

She lays the file she got down on his desk.

DEBBIE
Two.

WALKEN
When do I get to the fun part of being President, Debbie?

DEBBIE
The fun part, sir?

WALKEN
Yeah. Flying around on Air Force One, getting a good tee time at the Hilton
Head.

DEBBIE
I doubt you'll have much trouble getting good tee time, sir.

WALKEN
This is a weird-looking room.

DEBBIE
Truman called it the crown-jewel of the federal penal system.

WALKEN
You a Truman fan?

DEBBIE
Yes, sir.

WALKEN
Me, too.

DEBBIE
I would have taken you for an Eisenhower man, sir.

WALKEN
If Truman were alive today, he'd be a Republican.

DEBBIE
Oh, I doubt that very much.

WALKEN
You know, it's funny. This was never an ambition of mine. I never wanted to
be President of the United States.

DEBBIE
Neither did Mr. Truman. [pause] I'll start another call, sir?

He nods.

WALKEN
Thank you.

Debbie turns and goes back into her office. Walken clears his throat as he
picks up the file from his desk.

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Steve Atwood has left the Roosevelt Room and is walking through the
hallway. Josh spots him and follows him into the bathroom.

CUT TO: INT. - MEN'S RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Atwood is standing at a urinal when Josh comes in. Josh looks around to see
that no one else is in there. He walks over to the sink and begins reading
from a piece of paper in his hand.

JOSH
[reading] 'This isn't about partisan politics. It's about what's best for
the country. However long this crisis lasts we're fortunate to have President
Walken here to lead us." That's a great quote.

STEVE
Thanks.

JOSH
"However long this crisis lasts..." That's a nice...turn of phrase. Of
course, a more accurate description of that period of time would be "Till
President Bartlet signs the second letter and boots Walken's fat ass out of
our White House."

STEVE
What the hell are you going on about?

JOSH
You're campaigning in the middle of a national tragedy. Zoey Bartlet's out
in the field, breathing through a straw; you're test driving sound bites
for the next election? Straight answer, Steve, once in your life. What are
you guys up to? Closed-door meetings, planting quotes in the Times... What's
next? Spontaneous speeches on the House floor questioning President Bartlet's
fitness to lead?

STEVE
You don't get it, do you? Republicans are in awe of Bartlet. He recused
himself in the only way he could. In the way envisioned by the Constitution.

JOSH
None of the framers were afraid of the President's daughter being kidnapped
at musket-point.

STEVE
The whole notion of the 25th Amendment is that the institution matters more
than the man. Bartlet's decision was even more self-sacrificing because he
willingly gave power to his opposition.

JOSH
The institution may matter more, but it's your guy protecting it, not ours.

STEVE
A truly self-sacrificing act usually involves some sacrifice.

JOSH
So now you're goin to nail us to the cross?

STEVE
No. You beat the terrorists at their own game. We're not stupid, Josh. We
try to use this to our advantage, it'll blow up in our faces. We'd seem
callous and unfeeling, in contrast to Bartlet's extraordinary gesture of
courage and patriotism. And anyone who thinks otherwise, has a particularly
craven way of looking at politics.

He walks out of the restroom, leaving Josh alone. Josh leaves the restroom,
and when he does he finds people hurrying through the hallways. He runs
around the corner and into C.J.'s office. C.J., Carol, and two other people
are in there watching the TV.

 JOSH
What happened?

C.J.
Al Jazeera has a tape of Zoey.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walken, Leo, Casper, and a translator are standing around the TV watching
the broadcast.

CASPER
They first broadcast it four minutes ago.

WALKEN
What's he saying?

TRANSLATOR
He's claiming responsibility for the kidnapping, in the name of the Bahji
and Solomon de Mahmoud.

WALKEN
Who is that?

CASPER
One of the terrorists they want released from prison in Pakistan.

WALKEN
What-what is that she's holding?

CASPER
This morning's USA Today.

TRANSLATOR
They are again demanding the prisoners in Pakistan be released.

WALKEN
Is she even conscious? She looks drugged.

FITZWALLACE
Why is the quality so bad?

CASPER
We think it's a digital photograph, e-mailed to al Jazeera, probably over
a modem.

WALKEN
We're sure that's her?

LEO
It's her. What else is he saying?

TRANSLATOR
He is denouncing the United States, The Kingdom of Qumar, and our attack on
holy Moslem lands. And he says that if every American soldier is not out of
Qumar in 24 hours, they are going to shoot her.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE
* * *

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
      TUESDAY 1:30 AM
      HOUR 50

CUT TO: INT. - WHITE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Bartlet is walking through the hall of the White House. He has several Secret
Service Agents accompanying him. He walks past the Communications bullpen
window and sees Toby walk into his office. He walks into the Communications
bullpen and into Toby's office. A man seated a desk out side Toby's office
stands when he sees the President. Toby is just about to sit down when
Bartlet walks in.

BARTLET
Toby.

Toby stands back up.

BARTLET
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

TOBY
No, no, sir. I'm just surprised to see you down here, Mr. President.

BARTLET
They haven't revoked my pass yet. Please, sit.

Toby does.

TOBY
Is there anything I can do for you, sir, anything?

BARTLET
Do you have a cigarette? Abbey doesn't let me smoke in the Residence. I
usually keep a pack hidden in the office.

TOBY
I probably have a couple of cigars.

He gets up to get them.

BARTLET
No, thanks. I just thought somebody on your staff...

He walks around the room looking at different stuff.

BARTLET
What are you working on?

TOBY
The speech for when you come back.

BARTLET
How's it coming?

TOBY
Fine. Tough.

BARTLET
Mind if I have a look?

Toby hands him the pad. Bartlet begins reading it.

TOBY
It's not finished yet.

BARTLET
That's fine.

TOBY
I'm still working on the ending.

Bartlet continues to read the speech.

BARTLET
Where's the other one?

TOBY
What other one?

BARTLET
The other speech.

TOBY
We only wrote one.

Bartlet stares at Toby for a second before Toby grabs the other speech off
of his desk and hands it to Bartlet. Bartlet takes it and begins reading it.

BARTLET
You write this?

TOBY
No. Will.

Bartlet becomes teary-eyed as he reads the speech.

BARTLET
[reading] 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away...' You mind if I take
this with me?

Toby shakes his head.

BARTLET
Maybe I can bum a smoke off one of the agents.

Bartlet turns and begins to leave.

TOBY
You take care of yourself, Mr. President.

Bartlet leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - FBI COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

We see several people at work and on phones. We focus on one woman in
particular. She is on the phone. As she is on the phone, she gets a look of
concern on her face.

WOMAN
Can you hang on, officer?

She puts the phone on her desk and gets up. She walks through a door and
into the hallway. She walks around the corner into another office where
Agent Casper and another man are bent over a table looking at something.

WOMAN
Excuse me, sir. We may have something.

CUT TO: INT. - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

Leo and Admiral Fitzwallace are talking.

FITZWALLACE
You been home since this thing started?

LEO
I'm all right.

FITZWALLACE
You guys any closer to naming my successor?

LEO
You were serious about that? I thought you were joking.

FITZWALLACE
I promised Laura a month on a boat, kicking around the Caribbean for our
honeymoon. 32 years later, I think her patience is starting to finally
wearing a bit thin.

LEO
You sail?

ABBEY phone on the table starts ringing. Someone answers it as Fitzwallace
and Leo keep talking.

FITZWALLACE
The last thing I captained weighed 7,000 tons. I should be able to figure
out how to slip a 32-foot Catalina into a slip in Kingston.

OFFICER
[into phone] Yes, sir. Mr. McGarry is here. Yes, sir. [hanging up] Mr. McGarry,
sir. Admiral, the FBI ares on their way over. They think they found Zoey
Bartlet.

CUT TO: INT. MARINE ONE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Marine One is flying above some trees with its light on. Abbey, Bartlet,
Liz, Ellie, Leo, Charlie, and Agent Casper are inside. Casper is briefing
the President. He can barely be heard above the roar of the helicopter.

CASPER
A Virginia state Trooper responded to a domestic disturbance call outside of
Calverton. They both got drunk. He had let her out by the side of the road in
the middle of nowhere, so she called 911 on her cell. The trooper couldn't find
her. She had wandered off somewhere to try to get out of the rain. Guy checked
an old barn across the road from where she said she'd be. A white van...

The chopper lands and the steps are lowered. They all hurry out, down the
steps, and start across the field where they have landed. Many cars are
parked in the field and many agents as well as local police are standing
around talking. They are led over to an ambulance where Zoey is sitting in
the back. Abbey runs over to her.

ABBEY
Zoey!

We see Leo and Agent Casper talking to another agent.

AGENT
She's got a possible clavicle fracture, some irritation because of the tear
gas, and some ringing in her ears because of the flashbangs. No sign of sexual
assault, but she's still a bit out of it. They're going to run a tox screen...

LEO
They all dead?

AGENT
Sharpshooters got two using the spike-mike and thermal scanners. The other
one was sleeping when we came in. Tried to grab a weapon. We found her locked
in a closet in the back bedroom.

Someone calls for Agent Casper. Leo is left alone looking thoughtful.

We see Bartlet looking emotional and teary-eyed.

FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - WALKWAY - DAY

We see Bartlet, dressed in a full suit, walking down the walkway. Josh and
Toby are following behind him. They walk into the Oval Office where Leo,
Steve Atwood, President Walken, C.J., and Will are waiting. Bartlet walks
over behind the President's desk to speak to Walken.

BARTLET
Mr. President.

WALKEN
Good morning, sir.

BARTLET
You ready to do this?

WALKEN
Yes, sir.

Leo comes over to the desk and gives Bartlet a piece of paper. Bartlet takes
it and signs it. He hands the pen to Walken and then shakes his hand.

BARTLET
You going to run again?

WALKEN
I haven't decided.

BARTLET
If you do, let me know. I'll come campaign for you.

WALKEN
I'm not so sure that'd be a plus in my district, Mr. President.

BARTLET
You stick around for the press conference?

WALKEN
Thank you, sir, but I think the nation's best served by seeing only one
President at a time.

Walken turns to leave. Steve leaves in front of him. As he leaves, Walken
shakes Leo's hand.

BARTLET
Glen?

Walken turns around.

BARTLET
Thank you.

Walken nods his head proudly and walks out of the office.

TOBY
I have the final version of your speech for your review, Mr. President.

BARTLET
I won't need it. I'm going to use the one from last night.

He pulls the speech out of his inside coat pocket.

TOBY
Last night, sir?

BARTLET
I made a few changes, Will. I hope you won't mind.

WILL
No, sir. Of course not.

BARTLET
Thank you, everyone.

Everyone except Leo turns to leave.

TOBY
Thank you, Mr. President.

JOSH
Thank you, sir.

BARTLET
How much time do we have C.J?

C.J.
They're gathering now. We told the networks to be ready in ten minutes. Excuse
me, sir. Will the First Lady be joining you?

BARTLET
No. She's at Walter Reed with Zoey.

C.J.
Thank you, Mr. President.

She turns, leaves, and closes the door on her way out. Bartlet hands Leo
the piece of paper that he signed. Leo puts it in a blue folder.

LEO
Would you like us to get that up on the TelePrompTer for you, sir?

BARTLET
No. That won't be necessary.

Leo turns and leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY

Josh is sitting at his desk. The bulletin board now has only five pictures
on it, with a picture of Lewis Berryhill in the center. Josh gets up, walks
over to the board, and takes off one of the pictures. Steve Atwood walks to
his door.

STEVE
So, who's the lucky winner?

JOSH
The President hasn't decided.

STEVE
You got a favorite?

JOSH
President hasn't decided.

Donna walks up to the door.

DONNA
Josh, they're gathering.

Donna leaves.

STEVE
Nice office.

He smiles and leaves. Josh lays the picture down on his desk and walks out of
the office and over to where Donna is standing. She looks at him and nods. He
walks through the door as we hear the newscaster on the TV announcing the
President's speech.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

The senior staff is waiting along with Leo to walk with Bartlet out into
the Rose Garden.

WILL
Did we ever find those five Bahji sleepers?

LEO
No.

Bartlet comes out of the office and puts his speech paper into his inside
coat pocket.

LEO
Mr. President.

BARTLET
Are they ready for us, C.J.?

She nods. Bartlet indicates that he is ready, and she goes leaves.

BARTLET
Where are we on the Vice President?

LEO
We have several candidates, ready for your decision.

We hear C.J. announcing the President.


C.J. [OS]
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

Bartlet exits through the same door C.J. exited and walks down the walkway
toward the Rose Garden. The rest of the senior staff follows him. We hear
Bartlet begin the speech.

BARTLET [OS]
'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.'

CUT TO: INT. - ZOEY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Zoey is lying in bed. Charlie, Liz, Doug, and Ellie are sitting around her
bed watching Bartlet's speech. Abbey is standing at the window.

BARTLET [on TV]
Words I did not fully understand until our daughter was taken from us three
days ago. But now we can rejoice and be glad, for that which was lost has
been found. That my child is back in her mother's arms is serendipity and
grace; a second chance that will not slip through our hands again. I wish I
could tell you there's some new policy, some new weapons system - a silver
bullet, perhaps - that could meet this moment; that could keep us safe from
the terror that's now among us. But if I were to say that, I'd be lying. All
I can promise is that I will fight with every fiber of my being, every weapon
in our our arsenal, and with every ounce of God's grace...

DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.

BARTLET [VO][cont.]
...to keep us strong and free and safe.

FADE TO BLACK.
THE END.
