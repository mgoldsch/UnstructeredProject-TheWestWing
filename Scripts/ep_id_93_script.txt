TEASER

FADE IN: EXT. - MANCHESTER FARM - DREAM - DAY

We open on a shot of an open field. We next see a horse galloping and that
young Zoey Bartlet is riding it. Several flashes occur, in which the rider
changes between older and younger Zoey. We hear Bartlet calling to Zoey
as the horse begins to run faster. We see the young girl lean down on the
horse's neck, trying to keep herself from falling off.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - MORNING

Bartlet rolls over, startled by the dream he was having.

BARTLET
Zoey?

He realizes he was dreaming and sighs in exasperation.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - MORNING

We see Zoey laying on the couch with her head in her mother's lap. Zoey is
awake but Abbey is not. We see Bartlet come into the room from the bedroom
wearing his robe. He comes to stand behind the couch and he looks down at
Zoey. She realizes he is there and looks up at him.

ZOEY
Dad.

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

Josh and Leo are walking through the Roosevelt Room. They are talking as
they walk towards Leo's office.

JOSH
That wasn't the worst. The worst was the M-80s at the ballpark.

LEO
Mm-hmm.

JOSH
Me and Tommy Ledden and the other guys pulled our ammo and, in a burst of
patriotic pride, blew out the toilets behind the concession stand. Cute
girls were there, in shorts.

They have come into Leo's office. Margaret comes in from her office.

MARGARET
Is the Secretary of State supposed to be here?

LEO
Yeah. Is he? It was set last night. I put it on there where you said.

Leo goes to the door to call Secretary Berryhill in.

LEO
Secretary Berryhill.

BERRYHILL
Leo.

He comes in as Margaret goes back into her office. Josh shuts the door that
he and Leo walked in.

BERRYHILL
Josh.

JOSH
Mr. Secretary.

LEO
Gentlemen, please.

Berryhill sits down on the couch. Josh sits next to him. Leo sits across
from him.

BERRYHILL
Did you read Birardi's resignation letter in the Post?

LEO
Eloquent.

BERRYHILL
A little old-fashioned.

JOSH
A little? Aaron Burr's call to the interview at Weehawkin was less stilted.

BERRYHILL
Birardi blunted his protest by making it a laundry list; the bombings,
the assassination. I thought he was going to go after our neckties.

LEO
How are the Syrians?

BERRYHILL
Better; probably afraid they're next.

LEO
Anyone else making noise?

He shakes his head.

BERRYHILL
Mostly shows of support; regards to the First Family from the Saudis and Cairo.

LEO
Your address to the U.N.; went a long way.

JOSH
You're polling in the high 60s. Only the President's doing better.

BERRYHILL
You're polling on me? You guys must be desperate for good news.

LEO
Getting the President back in the Oval Office was a start, but the message
we need to send now is one of action. You want some coffee?

BERRYHILL
No, thanks.

JOSH
Our first priority is to name a Vice President.

LEO
The press is expecting us to lay out our timetable tomorrow, but we're
thinking what if, instead, we announce?

JOSH
Say, "This is our guy: Vice President of the United States."

LEO
Sound like a good start?

BERRYHILL
Sounds about right.

LEO
So if your President asks, you'll serve?

SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLES.
END TEASER.

ACT ONE

FADE IN: INT. - RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see that Bartlet is pouring himself and espresso or some other fancy
coffee. Zoey walks in.

ZOEY
Finally you join the 21st Century.

BARTLET
Can we keep this between us?

ZOEY
In the office?

BARTLET
I still take a plain, all-American cup of Joe.

ZOEY
Not like that. You doing okay, Dad?

Abbey walks in.

BARTLET
Sure.

ZOEY
Just wondering, because it's the 4th of July and we've been up for, like,
20 minutes...

BARTLET
I'm saving the Founding Fathers until lunch.

ZOEY
Still on?

BARTLET
Only if you're up to it.

ZOEY
I am.

ABBEY
Good morning.

BARTLET
Good morning.

ZOEY
Smell the coffee?

ABBEY
I could hear it. Could that thing be any louder?

ZOEY
I'll be right back to make yours.

ABBEY
Keep the ice on it.

Zoey leaves the kitchen. Abbey has begun making her breakfast. We see on
one TV, a story about the VP vacancy.

CUT TO: INT. - HALLWAY - NEAR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - DAY

Josh, C.J., and Will are walking into the Communications Office. They are
talking.

C.J.
You have no reservations?

JOSH
None.

C.J.
No qualms about DFCC travel or about working the rubber chicken circuit?

JOSH
He's on board.

WILL
So our message is stature.

C.J.
And national security. Toss some motherhood in the bag and dust fax it.

JOSH
With dignity. The guy's a war hero. He radiates Presidential. We don't need
to oversell this one.

TOBY
We need a war room. Get me someone from the Counsel's Office, Legislative
Affairs...

JOSH
Berryhill's already been through this as Secretary.

TOBY
He was confirmed by the Senate, not by the House. We've got 24 hours to
make this happen. Right out of the gate, even a whiff of a whiff of a rumor,
we're ready to bat it down.

C.J.
Smart offense.

WILL
Error-free ball.

JOSH
Knock yourselves out, but he's a slam-dunk.

TOBY
Okay, that's one to many sports metaphors. I want all of his public statements,
his activity on behalf of the party, his financial disclosure forms, his
video rentals, his post-its.

C.J.
I've got a brief.

WILL
You want me to start booking him?

JOSH
Actually...

TOBY
You're right. He's right. No interviews until we hear from the leadership
that he's going to be confirmed. This will go quickly.

C.J.
Quick enough for him to do the Sunday shows?

TOBY
Two days? You bet.

C.J.
Can we...

They begin walking toward the press room so that C.J. can be involved in
the discussion.

TOBY
We don't leave a help wanted sign hanging on the country for another news
cycle.

C.J.
We've got Zoey's pool spray to feed them today, but we won't stay ahead of
this for long.

WILL
Zoey's okay to do it?

C.J.
She said she is.

TOBY
When do we get the Republicans over?

JOSH
Before lunch. We show our respect, Berryhill's confirmed on a voice vote by
the middle of next week.

CAROL
C.J.?

C.J.
I know. Toby?

TOBY
Yeah.

Toby, C.J., and Carol walk off.

JOSH
You like him, right?

TOBY
Berryhill? I'm over the moon. This is my over-the-moon face.

He walks off. Will walks back into the Communications Office.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

C.J., Toby, and Carol are walking into C.J.'s office and they are talking.

C.J.
You see Birardi's resignation?

TOBY
You ready for it?

C.J.
"The President appreciates his long service, respects his right to differ,
and he will be missed." You look spiffy.

TOBY
You could look spiffy too if you ever went home.

C.J.
I'm clean. I showered. I wanted to ask, though, on the assassination...

TOBY
Avoid that word, for starters.

C.J.
Birardi's letter keeps it on the front page. The questions I keep getting
asked are "Why not a trial or a tribunal? Why cover it up? Why didn't we
simply detain him?".

TOBY
Stick to the script, you'll be fine.

C.J.
I tried to get more from the Pentagon, but they're keeping it classified.

TOBY
So send the questions to the Pentagon.

Amy walks up.

AMY
Hey. It's about the pool spray. The First Lady wanted me to ask...

C.J.
We'll see Zoey walk with her dad, we say she can walk thank God, and it puts
everyone's mind at rest.

AMY
Photos only?

C.J.
That's the beauty of a walk: you don't have to take questions.

AMY
And on the Truman Balcony tonight for the fireworks?

C.J.
Family photo. Just the White House photographer. We'll supply all the outlets
but reassure First Lady any hesitation on Zoey's part and we cancel it.

AMY
Yeah.

Amy walks off and C.J. walks into the briefing room.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

We see Donna walking to her cubicle and she is talking to Ryan, who doesn't
appear to hear anything because he's on the phone.

DONNA
Great. Ryan, you're here. I've got nine boxes that need to go over to the
OEOB, room 180. They call it the old energy plan room.

RYAN [into phone]
Yeah, it is a holiday but we just survived a national crisis, which I guess
you slept through, so there's a lot to do here.

He pulls the phone away from his ear and speaks to Donna.

RYAN
Donna, can you explain to this loser why I can't go sailing?

DONNA [into phone}
Dude, Ryan's not on board because he's taking some boxes over to the OEOB
for me.

She hangs the phone up and hands it back to Ryan.

DONNA
It's those big ones. It'll take a few trips. They need them right away.

Josh comes around the corner walking toward his office. Donna follows him.

DONNA
The new Speaker called again.

JOSH
Haffley? Now what? We already moved the meeting up so he could watch the
green flag at Daytona.

DONNA
I think it was his son's t-ball game.

JOSH
Yeah, whatever.

DONNA
He has some questions about the agenda.

JOSH
I'll bet he did. Did you tell him it was about the VP selection?

DONNA
I think he wants to hear some names.

JOSH
Well, he better be at the meeting.

Josh walks out of his office and Amy walks up to talk to him as he does.

AMY
Hey, Spanky. When was the last time you got a look at the CDC budget breakdown?

JOSH
Uh, everything before last Saturday is kind of fuzzy.

AMY
Ken Crupp heard HHS is reworking the whole thing.

JOSH
Uh, five days till markup, a lot of horse riding left to do.

AMY
Division of Violence Prevention; 65% cut.

JOSH
Really? First Lady pissed?

AMY
She's her... her attention is elsewhere.

JOSH
That's probably good.

AMY
Yeah, not really.

JOSH
She'd get worked up. I doubt she could do a whole lot about it.

AMY
She could do plenty.

JOSH
Then it's a damn shame.

AMY
There's a future for you in motivational speaking.

JOSH
So, take it to her. What do I know? Is she in the office today?

AMY
No.

JOSH
Monday? [pause] Let it go. You're going to have to breath through it for
a while.

AMY
Not my forte; waiting.

JOSH
You have other fortes.

AMY
What's that supposed to mean?

JOSH
Nothing. I didn't mean that.

AMY
You absolutely meant that.

JOSH
Okay, maybe I did.

AMY
Careful what you start.

She walks away.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

We see C.J. answering some questions on the TV.

KATIE [on TV]
... that the most practical reason for not engaging in the assassination of
foreign leaders is that our own officials and their families are vulnerable
to retaliation.

C.J. [on TV]
Abdul Shareef was not targeted as a foreign leader. He was stopped as a
terrorist from blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge. We should wrap up here
because Zoey Bartlet will be coming down soon and those of you in the pool
will want to get in position. If I can remind you, this young lady had been
through an ordeal. She's not going to take questions, so if you could show
some basic human... you know, I almost said decency, but don't worry, I'm back.

We pan into the Oval Office where Bartlet is meeting with several people
including Leo, Ron Butterfield, an unnamed General, and an unnamed FBI agent.

BARTLET
What's next?

GENERAL
Norfolk is remaining at ThreatCon 5. The training manuals confiscated in
Portland included blueprints for a radiological dispersion device and the guys
we detained in Tanzania yesterday were packing Botchelinum toxin and cyanide.

BARTLET
But we can go ahead and light some sparklers in our own backyard?

BUTTERFIELD
Along with our people, the FBI, the Park Service, Capitol and local police,
there'll be an extra 2,000 officers out.

FBI AGENT
And the Air Force has jets monitoring the airspace and there's a no-boating
zone enforced on the Potomac between 14th street and the Memorial Bridge.

BARTLET
An invitation to party if I ever heard one.

LEO
Very few local events have been effected.

BARTLET
What has?

FBI AGENT
A reading of the Declaration of Independence at the National Archives got
postponed because no one had cleared the fife and drum corps. And an overflow
group of immigrants taking their citizenship oath had to cancel. The VFW
hall they're using had a bomb scare.

BARTLET
Fine. Thank you all.

They all get up and leave. Bartlet walks over to his desk.

BARTLET
When do I sit down with Berryhill?

LEO
2:00.

BARTLET
Good. I've got a lunch I don't want to rush.

LEO
How's Zoey doing?

BARTLET
Really well, considering.

CHARLIE
They're on their way down.

BARTLET
Thanks.

Charlie shuts the door.

BARTLET
What's with this bomb scare at an immigration ceremony?

LEO
Immigration has been encouraging more district and neighborhood
ceremonies. Most of this group being sworn in are from Arab countries.

BARTLET
We're talking folks who have been interviewed and background-checked by two
agencies, taking classes to learn our language, passed exams on our history
and government, and been fingerprinted twice; these are the kinds of Arabs
we're talking about?

LEO
Yes, sir.

BARTLET
Let's find them an auditorium where they can safely take their oath.

LEO
Yes, sir.

Bartlet leaves the office.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

We see that Debbie has a large stack of papers at her desk.

BARTLET
Oh, man, I don't like the looks of all that.

DEBBIE
They call it nonessential for a reason, Mr. President.

CHARLIE
We'll send most of it down to the Auto-Pen.

BARTLET
The Auto-Pen couldn't do its thing while I was on hiatus?

DEBBIE
It raised some Constitutional issues we couldn't parse.

She has a laminated photo in her hand that she has a question about.

DEBBIE
Here. C.J. needed you to approve this. It's from the archives. She said
everyone will probably go with the firework shot, but this one is nice. It's
sweet.

CHARLIE
No it's not, they were laughing at me.

BARTLET
Was this your first time up at the farm? It was, wasn't it?

CHARLIE
Yeah, I got on and I stayed on.

Debbie's phone starts ringing.

BARTLET
You're a natural horseman, Charlie.

DEBBIE
Uh, Fiderer. ... Thank you.

She hangs the phone up.

DEBBIE
She's ready.

CUT TO: EXT. - SOUTH LAWN - PORCH - DAY

We see that Abbey, Zoey, and C.J. are ready, waiting to do the press
conference. Bartlet walks up.

BARTLET
Are you...

ABBEY
Uh...

ZOEY
Mom, I'm okay.

Bartlet takes Zoey by the arm and leads her. C.J. follows them. Abbey leans
against a pillar.

C.J.
Ready? You know how to do this. Just breathe and walk. You look great.

C.J. stops at the edge of the porch and Bartlet and Zoey continue on. They
are walking along a pathway. There are a lot of reporters and photographers on
the other side of a rope. Suddenly, Zoey stops and waves to the crowd. Bartlet
follows suit.

CUT TO: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

Leo, Josh and Toby are meeting with members of the Republican Leadership,
including Speaker of the House Haffley and Senate Majority Leader Royce.

LEO
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Leader, in the spirit of "Everyone wins," we wanted first
to thank all of you and the Republican leadership. We can feel proud of how
we criss-crossed the aisle in recent days. And second, we'd like to inform
you of the President's choice for Vice President.

ROYCE
So, there's nothing to the rumor that he begged Walken to stay?

JOSH
They're just good friends.

LEO
It's going to be Lewis Berryhill. He'll step down as Secretary of State.

ROYCE
Well, we've already confirmed him once. You're looking for an expedited
process?

TOBY
The country needs to move on.

ROYCE
He's an obvious choice: his military records, governmental service.

HAFFLEY
Frankly, I've got a problem.

JOSH
What kind of problem?

HAFFLEY
I don't have the votes. Not for Berryhill.

JOSH
The guy's a war hero. He's the most popular Secretary of State since... whoever
Lincoln had. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.

HAFFLEY
Seward. Lincoln had Seward, who was stabbed in his bed, and Berryhill wasn't
confirmed by the House.

JOSH
No one's confirmed by the House. This is your one at bat.

LEO
We should let them have the room.

HAFFLEY
Leo, no, I don't need to be schooled by my Senate brethren. I get what my
job is.

JOSH
Advice and consent, that's your job. Confirm the President's choice as
qualified.

TOBY
No one can say that Lewis Berryhill isn't qualified.

HAFFLEY
But you don't want a fight. Berryhill's a fight.

LEO
Mr. Speaker, I know you haven't been through this before...

HAFFLEY
None of us has. Other administrations haven't lost their Vice President to
a sex scandal.

ROYCE
Mr. Speaker.

HAFFLEY
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not here just to be a naysayer. I have suggestions.

JOSH
You have suggestions?

HAFFLEY
Here are a few names that could be easily confirmed.

He pulls a slip of paper out of his inside jacket pocket and slides it to
Leo. Leo looks at it and then shows it to Josh.

JOSH
This is your list?

Haffley nods his head. They show the paper to Toby.

ROYCE
Do you mind?

Toby hands the paper to Royce.

LEO
Senator?

ROYCE
I have no problem with this list.

Haffley takes the paper from him and slides it back across the table.

FADE OUT.
END ACT ONE.
* * *

ACT TWO

FADE IN: INT. - HALLWAY - DAY

Leo, Toby, and Josh are walking away from the Roosevelt Room.

JOSH
What the hell just...

As they walk by the Communications Office, Leo calls out to Will.

LEO
Will. In the Oval, and grab C.J.

JOSH
We just... we got tagged.

They walk into the Outer Oval Office.

JOSH
Idiot thinks he tagged us.

TOBY
He did.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is meeting with Leo, Josh, Toby, C.J., and Will.

JOSH
He's bluffing.

WILL
We don't blink.

LEO
What the hell is he thinking? Is he just in over his head?

JOSH
He's an idiot. And he's bluffing.

WILL
We put up Berryhill and we wait for the Republicans to self-destruct.

C.J.
If we have the time.

JOSH
He's an idiot, he's bluffing, and we're going to destroy him.

LEO
You worried about it leaking or are you worried about our numbers?

C.J.
Both. How long can we spin this so our numbers hold? If it drags on and gets
ugly and people have time to worry...

TOBY
We've got a fight; with this list it's a joke. August Adar would bore the
country into a stupor and Starkey is, forgive me, sir, more likely to keel
over in the next three years than you are.

JOSH
That's what Haffley's counting on. The longer he drags this out, the longer
he's next in line.

WILL
Diane Frost is a serious name.

JOSH
Diane is a serious loon of the left.

TOBY
I love Diane Frost. I'd marry Diane Frost if I were a member of her stated
sexual preference, but Diane is the definition of unelectable.

JOSH
That's their agenda: sniper anyone who looks hard to beat next time around.

C.J.
I thought this choice wasn't about partisan politics.

JOSH
It is now.

BARTLET
Come on, guys, the door is closed. This has always been about partisan
politics. One reason we were dancing on the tables this morning is because
Berryhill looks good to take over in three years.

TOBY
He also looks good right now.

WILL
Who is Robert Russell?

JOSH
He's the Congressman from Western Colorado. And I don't mean the state,
I mean the mining company.

TOBY
Bob Russell is not Presidential.

JOSH
Are we actually discussing the list?

C.J.
We're dissing the list. Wasn't Russell... is he "Bingo Bob"?

TOBY
That's Russell.

JOSH
Let's not even dis the list.

BARTLET
Okay, listen up. We're sticking with Berryhill. I want to announce tomorrow.

LEO
Let's check in with our friends, make sure they've got our backs.

TOBY
What about the list?

LEO
Get these folks in. You and Josh have some nice chats.

JOSH
You want to placate Haffley?

LEO
I want to try. If he thinks he's getting to advise, maybe he'll consent. And
if you could say hello, too, sir.

BARTLET
Hello is about all they're going to get.

LEO
Whatever happens has to happen now. Time's not our friend here, Josh.

JOSH
I'm on it.

Josh leaves.

LEO
C.J., can you...?

BARTLET
Toby, when's the briss?

TOBY
It was this morning, sir.

C.J.
This morning? You dog.

TOBY
We've been a little busy.

C.J.
I'll get you later.

BARTLET
Nice service?

TOBY
For me. I'm not sure Huck enjoyed it as much.

BARTLET
Quite a way to start the morning.

TOBY
It was.

BARTLET
And it's just the beginning.

They leave.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA - DAY

Josh walks into the bullpen and comes over to Donna's desk. He hands her
the list.

JOSH
Call 'em in; 20 minutes apiece. Make it clear this is not about the Vice
Presidency. They are not candidates for jobs, you know, listed in the
Constitution.

DONNA
Are they candidates?

JOSH
They are not. They are not. Repeat that.

DONNA
They are not.

Josh walks into his office and shuts the door.

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - DAY

Leo and C.J. are talking.

C.J.
They were becoming citizens?

LEO
Before the bomb scare they were. Margaret's checking into other venues.

MARGARET
GW's getting back to me about a hall.

C.J.
You want to release that the President's helping them find a site for their
swearing in?

LEO
Wait until we're sure we've solved it.

They start walking.

LEO
On the other thing...

C.J.
I'm fine.

LEO
Toby thought you were...

C.J.
Toby's wrong. I'm not.

LEO
Birardi's resignation letter was persuasive.

C.J.
It was, but I'm not... I don't know why Toby...

LEO
You know what?

He stops.

LEO
I'm sorry, I gotta...

C.J.
Sure.

As C.J. walks away we pan around to see Amy and Abbey walking into the
building.

AMY
And Secretary Ralph sent some beautiful calilillies.

ABBEY
I'll give him a call. Anything else?

AMY
Ken Crupp called, a couple of times.

ABBEY
I've got his card. Thank him for me. [pause] What?

AMY
I think Ken's concerned about the HHS Appropriation. There were some changes
in the CDC budget. The Committee's going to markup. Violence Prevention
could lose 65%.

ABBEY
Sorry, what are you...?

AMY
I'm sorry. It was nothing.

ABBEY
Amy, you're going to have to handle things for me a little while longer.

AMY
I know. Do you want me to...?

ABBEY
I trust you. That's why I hired you.

Abbey walks off and Amy leaves in the opposite direction.

CUT TO: INT. - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Debbie is sitting at her desk when Abbey walks in. She stands.

DEBBIE
Ah, hello. He's just finishing a call with Congresswoman Frost.

ABBEY
I'm looking for my daughter.

DEBBIE
She's meeting with Will. But, I... he... don't you... he'd want me to...

ABBEY
No, no, no. No, don't bother.

DEBBIE
Uh, Mrs. Bartlet, I can't tell you how hard I prayed for you.

Abbey looks as though she is genuinely touched at the sentiment.

ABBEY
I appreciate that.

DEBBIE
Well, you shouldn't. I'm not very religious, so there's the risk that my
praying could be taken as insincere or even an affront, which, if it's a
vengeful God, could have made matters worse.

ABBEY
Well, it didn't. So maybe there's a clue.

Abbey turns to leave.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - DAY

Zoey and Charlie are sitting in front of the window and Zoey is looking at
some of the mail that came in while she was kidnapped.

ZOEY
So, how many of these letters have come?

CHARLIE
At last count, 10,000.

ZOEY
Oh, here's another good one. "Dear Zoey, I hope they don't kill you. But if
they do, then it'll be quick."

CHARLIE
Zoe.

ZOEY
She put a little smiley face at the end.

Will walks in.

CHARLIE
You don't need to read them.

ZOEY
Sure I do.

CHARLIE
No, you don't.

WILL
Sorry.

ZOEY
No, you're busy.

WILL
Not at all.

ZOEY
Oh, is it okay if Charlie stays? He thinks he needs to babysit me.

Will sits down across from Zoey.

WILL
Sure. How was lunch?

ZOEY
You know dad: "Jefferson Lives."

CHARLIE
Will hasn't been here.

ZOEY
Oh, my dad loves 4th of July stuff, like Jefferson and Adams dying on the
same day.

CHARLIE
Adams thought Jefferson had survived him. "Jefferson Lives" were his last
words.

ZOEY
It appeals to dad; you know, hope and irony.

WILL
With a little party politics thrown in. Shall we get busy? You want to draft
a letter, a response to the country, is that right?

Will takes out a pad of paper and gets ready to write some things down.

ZOEY
Yes.

WILL
So I'm going to ask you some questions and come up with a draft for you
to review.

ZOEY
Okay.

WILL
We'll start with "How do you feel?".

She looks as though she is not sure.

WILL
Don't worry about phrasing or brevity, I'll do that part.

ZOEY
I feel lucky. I feel happy to be back... and grateful. I feel a little bad
that so much had to go into this. Saving me, and all. I wish I hadn't... that
it didn't happen.

WILL
We all do.

ZOEY
And that I had to go...

CHARLIE
It wasn't fault.

ZOEY
Okay, so that's good, huh?

WILL
Uh-huh.

ZOEY
It wasn't...?

She stands.

WILL
That was... yeah. I'll get back to you.

ZOEY
Cool. Thanks will.
She leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - MURAL ROOM - DAY

Josh and Toby are meeting with SENATOR STARKEY, regarding the VP list given
to them by Haffley.

SENATOR STARKEY
And, of course, there's the necessity to lessen the ceremonial burdens.

TOBY
Absolutely, Senator Starkey.

STARKEY
In ways, John Hoynes didn't...

JOSH
Let's not talk about that.

STARKEY
I'm saying the agenda could be strengthened if more of the President's
ceremonial burden was removed.

JOSH
We don't disagree.

STARKEY
Good.

TOBY
Do you have a few minutes to say hello to the President?

They get up.

STARKEY
I'm at his disposal.

They lead Senator Starkey into the hallway and shut the door behind him. Josh
sighs, as though he is tired of the charade. Toby goes to the door that
leads in from the Outer Oval Office and opens it. CONGRESSMAN ROBERT "BOB"
RUSSELL comes in. He and Toby shake hands.

TOBY
Congressman Russell.

CONGRESSMAN ROBERT "BOB" RUSSELL
Mr. Ziegler.

He walks over to shake Josh's hand.

RUSSELL
Mr. Lyman.

JOSH
Josh. We met at the...

RUSSELL
Good memory. I wasn't sure you could pick me out of a crowd.

JOSH
Luckily, I didn't have to, Bob. We'd like to establish from the outset you
can imagine what the press climate is around here and why we can't afford to,
well, make decisions before we've made them.

RUSSELL
Sure.

TOBY
There's to be no discussion whatsoever in this meeting of any position in
the federal government that may or may not be open.

RUSSELL
Understood.

JOSH
Which is not to say this meeting is about that.

RUSSELL
Okay.

TOBY
What are your thoughts on the President's and the Party's agenda for the
next three years?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is sitting with Berryhill and they are talking.

BARTLET
There hasn't been much about the last couple of weeks that I wouldn't
rather erase, but this I'll keep. Lewis, I'm hoping to announce you as my
new Vice President.

BERRYHILL
Our new Speaker balking?

BARTLET
Yeah. This could be rockier than we had hoped.

BERRYHILL
I can handle it.

BARTLET
Not just for us, but for the country.

BERRYHILL
Sir, as Secretary of State I've shown you my conciliatory side. But in my
heart of hearts I'm spoiling for a fight.

BARTLET
Me, too.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - DAY

Abbey is sitting down with Ron Butterfield. They are discussing Zoey's Secret
Service detail.

BUTTERFIELD
We're going to double her detail; visible presence, in diamond formation,
flanking her just like we do the President.

ABBEY
No more running out for yogurt?

BUTTERFIELD
We need three days advance notice for site sweeps and background checks on
anyone she may come in contact with.

ABBEY
I'm going to need a little time to process this.

BUTTERFIELD
Of course.

They stand.

ABBEY
I do have one question.

We hear a knock at the door. Leo walks in.

LEO
Sorry, I didn't hear this was moved up.

ABBEY
We're just finishing.

BUTTERFIELD
There'll be a written report on the new protocols on your desk by COB.

LEO
Great.

ABBEY
Feel free to copy Leo, but I'd like the report delivered to me directly, Ron.

BUTTERFIELD
Fine.

Ron turns to leave but then turns around.

BUTTERFIELD
Did you have a question? You were saying you had a question.

ABBEY
How would you compare the Residence with the Farm?

BUTTERFIELD
In terms of security?


ABBEY
Yes.

LEO
What are you thinking...?

ABBEY
I don't know yet. Ron?

BUTTERFIELD
Well, as you're aware we have the farm continually secured. It doesn't have
bulletproof windows or a crash-proof gate. Here, we're in a fortress. On
the other hand, the White House is a target; ground-zero. It's probably 6-to-1.

ABBEY
Thank you.

Ron leaves. Leo sits down.

LEO
I hadn't heard you were thinking about New Hampshire. That might be the best...

ABBEY
I moved the meeting up because I didn't want you here.

LEO
In the meeting?

ABBEY
In the Residence.

LEO
Yeah. I've been trying to... I thought... you need some space.

ABBEY
She's back. She's safe. She's going to stay safe.

LEO
We all want what's best for Zoey.

ABBEY
You laid us open. You laid me and my daughters wide open. And God knows what
else there is that I don't know about.

LEO
There is nothing else.

ABBEY
I swear to God, Leo, don't... 72 hours; the bruises aren't even... did you
see her face? For God's sake, don't ask me to trust you.

LEO
I'm not.

ABBEY
And don't think you took the bullet. I blame Jed. He did this.

She gets up and leaves.

FADE OUT.
END ACT TWO.

ACT THREE

FADE IN: INT. - ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

Josh and Toby are meeting with the Democratic leadership including House
Minority Leader Sheila and Senate Minority Leader Wendall.

 WENDALL
We understand the choice. He's a popular Secretary. But he runs State like
a dictator.

TOBY
Come on.

WENDALL
I know, I'm overstating, but many Democrats see Berryhill as aloof.

SHEILA
And not only because he's never run for office, not even dogcatcher. He's
not a team player. A minor flaw, maybe, but you're anointing the guy.

WENDALL
And once he's in the spotlight...

SHEILA
Especially if he's stuck in the spotlight while the Speaker grinds the
government to a halt.

TOBY
So, you think Berryhill's warts are going to start to show?

JOSH
You're assuming the Republicans are going to follow through. Haffley's list
of candidates was amateur hour.

WENDALL
There are some decent names on that list.

SHEILA
If you insist on Berryhill we'll go to the mat. But it'll only prove how
impotent you've made up.

TOBY
How's that?

SHEILA
You guys knighted Haffley when you moved Walken out. Haffley's not
bluffing. Haffley doesn't bluff.

JOSH
Okay. So, we fight for Berryhill. We only need a majority; four guys to
break ranks and join with you. It's that simple.

SHEILA
Haffley knows he's got 'em on choke chains. And you won't get them; not in
a day, not in a month. It's that simple.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is meeting with SENATOR ADAR. Adar is talking about Jefferson and
Adams, and his tone is nothing if not monotonous.

SENATOR ADAR
So, there he was, on his deathbed, 50 years to the day, 50 years since
the signing of the Declaration, July 4th, Independence Day. There he is,
on his deathbed...

BARTLET
Which one are you with now, Senator Adar? Jefferson?

ADAR
Adams. But of course both of them were dying on the same 4th of July, that's
what's so amazing.

BARTLET
Ahh.

ADAR
50 years since that day in Independence Hall, immortalized in Trumball's famous
painting of the scene. Two great giants dying on their country's birthday,
after years of friendship and feuding. [pause] As diplomats in Paris...

BARTLET
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Senator.

He gets up and heads toward the door.

BARTLET
This will only take a second.

He walks into the Outer Oval Office and over to Debbie's desk.

BARTLET
Debbie, you were supposed to interrupt after five minutes.

DEBBIE
It's only been three, sir.

BARTLET
Tell Leo I can't take any more of these.

DEBBIE
There's only a couple more.

Bartlet stops at the door and takes a deep breath before going in.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY

Josh, Toby and Will walk into Josh's office.

WILL
Wait, the Democrats actually like the list?

JOSH
They aren't wild about Berryhill. Donna!

TOBY
Our esteemed Minority Leader thinks it's not a bluff and we won't win a
battle in the House.

JOSH
Our esteemed Minority Leader is running for President in three years. Donna,
get me Leo!

Ryan sticks his head in the door.

RYAN
Donna went to the bathroom.

JOSH
She's not allowed to do that. Just get me Leo.

RYAN
Uh, Leo McGarry?

JOSH
Yes, Leo McGarry.

C.J. comes to the door and bumps into Ryan as she is coming into the office.

C.J.
They leaked the list; the Starkey Russell list.

WILL
Is that bad? It makes Berryhill look even better.

TOBY
Guys, we can't confirm Berryhill.

C.J.
We can't?

WILL
We're having trouble with the Democrats.

C.J.
Wow. Along with the Republicans, that's kind of everyone.

TOBY
We've got to move on.

JOSH
Move on? We don't move on from our first post-Walken showdown. This is the
single, most defining decision the President makes.

TOBY
No kidding. And time's running out and if we don't find someone they'll
confirm by tomorrow...

C.J.
We had other names.

Ryan comes back in.

RYAN
Hey, uh, sorry. Does anyone know Mr. McGarry's extension?

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated at his desk and is on the phone. Charlie knocks and comes in.

BARTLET [into phone]
Uh-huh. ... Uh-huh. Yeah. ... I'll let you get back to your catfish,
Governor. ... No, I'm not much of a fisherman. ... Maybe we will. ... And
a happy 4th to you.

He hangs the phone up.

CHARLIE
Sir, do you have a moment?

BARTLET
You don't want to be Vice President, do you?

CHARLIE
No, sir.

BARTLET
Then you can stay.

CHARLIE
It's about Zoey.

BARTLET
Did something happen?

CHARLIE
She had trouble talking to Will.

BARTLET
Really? She was fearless with the press.

CHARLIE
Yes, sir. She does that.

We see a flash, in which Zoey is riding the horse from Bartlet's dream. The
horse jumps over a low fence.

BARTLET
You've said this before.

CHARLIE
Sir?

CUT TO: EXT. - MANCHESTER FARM - FLASHBACK - DAY

Bartlet, Charlie, and Abbey are standing along the side of the fence, and
they are watching Zoey ride the horse.

BARTLET
Look at that. Fearless.

CHARLIE
She puts up a good front.

BARTLET
Name one thing, one thing, my little girl's afraid of.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Charlie is talking to Bartlet.

CHARLIE
She knows you like to see her strong. She thinks what happened was her fault.

We see another flash of the horse now running faster and Zoey trying to
stay on.

CHARLIE
I'm sorry, sir, but...

BARTLET
Her mother wants to take her back to New Hampshire for a while. What do
you think?

CHARLIE
I think her momma's right.

BARTLET
Hmm.

Charlie leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - JOSH'S OFFICE - DAY

Josh is sitting at his desk writing on a pad of paper. We see that the
bulletin board is back with at least three pictures on it, one of which is
Berryhill. Josh looks upset as though he has failed. Amy comes in and starts
talking really fast and she is excited about what she has gotten accomplished.

AMY
I just got off the phone. I need you to call Dule. I know it isn't at the
top of your to-do list, but I've got the Chairman on-board if he has a little
cover which Dule will agree to if you ask...

JOSH
Amy...

AMY
I know, I know; smallpox and anthrax were front and center but we spent
years getting violence recognized as a health threat...

JOSH
You've got to stop.

AMY [cont.]
... and if women and children aren't safe in their own homes, who needs
national security.

JOSH
Okay, I'm begging you, stop. S-stop talking... y-you're a machine; my head's
going to explode.

AMY
You said if I got the First Lady...

JOSH
We don't have a Vice President! Get it? That's our first thing and I can't
get it done. I can't get Berryhill confirmed. The one guy the President wants,
and-and I can't get it done. So, could you, just... be quiet for one moment?

AMY
Sorry. B-Berryhill's perfect.

JOSH
I-I mean it, one minute, in silence. Can you manage that?

AMY
But, I...

JOSH
You can't do it, can you?

Josh stands.

AMY
You...

JOSH
See?

She looks at her watch. We see her take her shoes off and she sits on the
windowsill. Josh comes back and sits down at his desk. He notices that Amy
has her feet propped up on his desk. He laughs when he sees that she has
her watch out and she is watching the seconds. He gets up and walks over to
her. He takes the watch from her and then bends down to kiss her. After they
kiss, she gets her shoes and walks out the door.

CUT TO: INT. - RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY

Bartlet is seated while Zoey is packing some things into a suitcase.

ZOEY
I can't believe you're doing this.

BARTLET
We talked about going up to the farm for a long time.

ZOEY
Later on, all together.

Abbey walks in.

ZOEY
You guys just ganged up on me.

BARTLET
That's right. Your mother and I are a united front, so don't bother.

Abbey looks at him and says nothing. Bartlet gets up to help her pack.

BARTLET
Come on, this is going to be good. You'll have the orchard to walk in. Once
that shoulder heals, you'll have Quince to ride. I'll be up as soon as I
can. There's only one thing you have to do for me: give yourself time. Don't
try to rush this.

Abbey has been standing at the edge of the room listening to the
conversation. She leaves.

ZOEY
There was an arm... grabbing me. When I start to fall asleep, it comes back.

BARTLET
We're going to help you. We're all going to help.

He continues to help her pack her things.

FADE OUT.
END ACT THREE.

ACT FOUR

FADE IN: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet and Leo come in from the portico. They are talking about Berryhill.

BARTLET
So the question now is how big a battle is Berryhill worth.

LEO
That sums it up, sir.

Debbie knocks and comes in.

BARTLET
He's eager for it, by the way.

LEO
Berryhill?

BARTLET
Too eager, maybe.

DEBBIE
Congressman Russell is here, sir.

BARTLET
Who?

DEBBIE [whispering]
"Bingo Bob."

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - DAY

Toby and C.J. are looking at baby pictures.

C.J. [laughing]
Look at that. Oh, my God.

TOBY
He looks a little pissed in that one.

C.J.
You look kind of...

TOBY
Yeah, he hates me already.

C.J.
And Molly.

TOBY
Well, her brother got a Hebrew name so she had to have one.

C.J.
Where's Andy? Was she even there?

TOBY
You gonna step out for the fireworks.

C.J.
I don't know. I may go home.

TOBY
You should. You've been going all at it without a break.

C.J.
I'm okay.

TOBY
I went over the briefings from the last few days. There weren't many questions
about the covert operation.

C.J.
There were questions.

TOBY
Why didn't Shareef have a trial or a tribunal? Who asked that?

C.J.
They're my questions, Toby. I'm asking. You read Birardi's
resignation? "Violence is the last resort of civilized nations. Violence
wrapped in secrecy is the choice of thugs."

TOBY
You think we're thugs?

C.J.
I don't know.

TOBY
You want to keep talking?

She shakes her head.

C.J.
Huh-uh.

TOBY
Let me know.

He leaves.

CUT TO: INT. - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Bartlet is seated and talking with Congressman Russell.

BARTLET
I'm glad you were able to stop by.

RUSSELL
I wouldn't miss a chance to discuss the party's agenda, sir.

BARTLET
We can toss out the script. The list is out there now.

RUSSELL
Great. [pause] Great we can talk directly, not great that the list was leaked.

BARTLET
Were you surprised to find your name on that list, Robert?

RUSSELL
It's Bob. Robert's my dad. And, uh, yes, sir, I never thought I'd be sitting
here today.

BARTLET
This place is full of surprises.

RUSSELL
If this is a courtesy to the Speaker, I won't waste your time with a long
pitch.

BARTLET
No, please.

RUSSELL
I get along with people. They like me in the House because I don't ruffle
feathers, and they like me back home because I honestly enjoy a good rubber
chicken. Something to do with the cooking I grew up on. And it may look like
I'm awful cozy with the mining industry, but West Co. employs five times as
many of my constituents as anyone else in my district.

BARTLET
Are you a horseman, Bob? I'm looking at your boots.

RUSSELL
Oh, I love to ride. You?

He shakes his head.

BARTLET
My youngest daughter is the one with the talent.

RUSSELL
Praise the good Lord for her safe return.

BARTLET
We do.

RUSSELL
No, I wear these boots, um... oh, I could give you some crap about remembering
my roots, but I wear these because I have flat feet and they don't hurt
my arches.

BARTLET
Well, thank you for coming by on such short notice.

They stand.

RUSSELL
Uh, let me go on the record. If you were to offer the job, I would be honored.

BARTLET
Thank you.

RUSSELL
But I would need a couple of things.

BARTLET
Oh?

RUSSELL
I wasn't close enough to say for sure about your relationship with John
Hoynes, but as your Vice President I would want more access.

BARTLET
Uh-huh.

RUSSELL
Direct access; weekly lunch, drinks; especially since we don't know each other.

BARTLET
Sounds like you'd be a Vice President who'd be looking to move up.

RUSSELL
I'm not trying to run out the clock on you, but I'm sure that my name
came up because some see me as the bland candidate, nobody's nightmare,
the triumph of mediocrity. If I were to take the job, I'd mean to confound
those expectations. And I want you to know that.

BARTLET
Any other ways I can sweeten the offer for you, Bob?

CUT TO: INT. - LEO'S OFFICE - EVENING

Leo is seated, watching TV, when Bartlet knocks and enters.

BARTLET
I'm sending my girls home.

LEO
I heard.

BARTLET
You want to say goodbye?

LEO
Abbey and I spoke earlier.

Bartlet indicates for Leo to sit. He does, and Bartlet comes to sit by him.

BARTLET
227 years ago, a bunch of guys got together on the 4th of July and decided,
because they didn't have any cherry bombs, they would declare some self-evident
truths.

LEO
Fed up with democracy, are we?

BARTLET
I called Lewis Berryhill. I told him it wasn't going to work out.

LEO
You didn't want to fight?

BARTLET
I did want to fight but the country needs a President who's doing their
work, and since they put their trust in a guy whose mortality is showing,
they deserve a chain of command that's irrefutable.

LEO
So who is it?

BARTLET
Ben Franklin thought the only hope for democracy was if people respected
each other enough to compromise. The folks in  Western Colorado had four
chances to change their mind about Bob Russell and they haven't.

LEO
Bob Russell? Really?

BARTLET
He ain't my choice, but hey, we hated the last guy, so let's start the
vetting process.

LEO
You want to tell the gang?

BARTLET
You do it. I'm done for the day.

LEO
Actually, Mr. President, you have one more thing.

CUT TO: INT. - AUDITORIUM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

A large group of Arab people are assembled to take their oath of citizenship. A
federal judge is giving the oath.

JUDGE
...that I will perform work of national importance...

GROUP
...that I will perform work of national importance...

JUDGE
...when required by law.

GROUP
...when required by law.

JUDGE
And I take this obligation freely...

Bartlet and Leo walk in to the room.

GROUP
And I take this obligation freely...

JUDGE
...without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

GROUP
...without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

JUDGE
So help me God.

GROUP
So help me God.

BARTLET
Thanks, Leo.

JUDGE
Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States.

The group claps as Bartlet comes to the podium at the front of the room.

BARTLET
Thank you, your honor. Please...

They all sit.

BARTLET
My fellow Americans, congratulations and welcome. I hear you had some trouble
finding a safe place to take your oath today. Our Founding Fathers were in
a similar predicament. In many ways our great Declaration of Independence
was a work order issued under fire. One we still struggle to fulfill. Now,
if you'll please stand, place your hand over your heart, and say with me...

The group begins to recite the pledge.

GROUP
I pledge allegiance...

CUT TO: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Abbey and Zoey are getting into a limo and they're getting ready to
leave. Charlie is there to see them off. We can still hear the group reciting
the pledge.

it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

CUT TO: EXT. - WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

We open on a shot of several magnificent fireworks going off in the sky
against the backdrop of the Washington Monument. We see Josh and Ryan at
the buffet getting several glasses of champagne. They bring them over to
where Donna, Toby, Will, and Amy are standing. They watch the fireworks
for several moments, and then Josh looks down to where Amy is standing. She
looks back at him. She then decides to leave. She walks away. Josh turns to
see her leave and follows her.

CUT TO: INT. - C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We see C.J. sitting at her desk. She is staring out the window, thinking. We

CUT TO: EXT. - MANCHESTER FARM - FLASHBACK - DAY

We see the horse that Zoey is riding is moving fast and is about to buck Zoey

YOUNG ZOEY
I wasn't scared, Daddy. It was fun.

We see a shot from the walk that afternoon.
